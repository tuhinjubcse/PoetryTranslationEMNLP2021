vanföreställningarna existe; detexist
denied; the sterile Sisters of the Rhine
With forceps in the mental hospital.
Stuffed with talc, marked
Smelled, warped, to omen, omen
Stretching backwards and forwards
is the faerial in lerhyddan outside the village
the moonlit isolation
Bannlyst, marketed
Blurred in sign, a feather to companionship
that she would talk to and swallow, eat
"Flimmer, flimmer there was"
white flickering also among the frosty nights
# Deeper and deeper down in the valley #
Remember that she is not dead until she's warm
And dead lavendellila fingrar, tongue
Sweet biscuits; meatballs; watermelons
Mummy, mumbling
father, fathers
Girls Ifigenia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's most beautiful when it shimmers
# All the love in heaven rhymes #
Ligger juicy in a dark light
Over the Earth,
Över markens hus
♪ All's piety, all is smeared with hands
Gentlemen, stretch out the farthest shores.
Everything is near, everything is far away
Everything is taken for granted
human being as loan
Everything is mine and all shall be delivered from me
Inom kort ska allt tagas ifrån mig
# Tears, clouds, the land where I walk #
I shall vandra -
Lonely without trace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my love for money,
for me there was no other way to get,
I sing beautifully, in scorching streams,
sjung schön om Love still.
The dream, which never rests,
as dream was the beautiful to get,
for him who was banished from Eden,
Eden is an Eden anyway.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I stand and look at the world through the gallret;
I can, I don't want to slit my throat,
It's so good to see how life sings
And scavenge the high chaff toward the calf,
So painful smooth and luring the sounds,
When laughter and song come through the galletine.
It's riddled with asp and al and birch,
where above stands branten furumörk,
The healthy smell runs through the gall bladder.
And over the wicked which curses thee,
In every drop is a pearl,
Look how it's slipping through the gall bladder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's whistling boats there and singing
with horn music and muntra singers
and happy people in thousands,
who dredged out to feast in the mountains and valleys;
I wanna, I want to, it's my fault. I gotta get out of here.
and drink life, if only for a minute,
I don't want to slow down behind the bar!
Forgeves skall jag böja, skall Jag rista
the old obedient hard gallret
- it doesn't want to go wrong, it wants to stay right,
you in my self is smitt and nitat gallret,
And first, when I myself shatter, the gallet shrinks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Västvinden goes.
West Wind
in through open window
Bläddrar i uppslagen bok.
So it reads itself.
Fernissan on åran
Torque faster now
and at least one fly
Always staying
in the hardened, clear masses.
Like a question.
Out of the crystal clear dark and nightly dimension.
And the book reads itself
not utan eftertanke.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script was bold and read quickly.
It was the cheapest in the wholesale trade.
And I discovered, eleven-year-old, soon
That there wasn't much to collect.
Nightmares of the Hemisphere
And detective stories from the Riviera.
which at that time was a remote country.
But the name stuck;
Can time be delayed?
And if you could,
Isn't that harmful to a single life?
Yet I know I've wasted my time.
The endless boring hours in school
And the enemy, the one who does not –
Not even the minute watcher wanted to move.
