Delusions existed.
denied; the sterile Rhenish sisters.
He was incarcerated in a mental hospital.
They're labeled with stickers.
Smelled, smelled. Towel, towel.
The other way around, if there's nowhere else to go.
It's the butterfly in the pond outside the village.
It's the moonlit isolation.
It's embedded, labeled.
bleeding in signs, a dog in company.
She was going to talk to him and swallow, eat.
There were glimmers.
There's a lot of white floating in the ice sheets as well.
And they went deeper and further down into the valley.
She remembers that she's not dead until she gets warm.
And dead lavender buds, tears.
The yellow teeth; the flesh on the bones; and the water.
Mummy, mumbling.
Fathers, fathers.
The daughters of Ifigenia.

It's most beautiful when it shines.
All of that love goes up in the sky.
Ligger collected in a dark light.
Over the Earth.
Above the house on the ground.
It's all about gentleness. It is all wrapped in hands.
The Lord Himself wipes out the far-flung seas.
Everything is near, everything is far away.
Everything is taken for granted.
The idea is that people can borrow money.
Everything is mine and everything is going to be taken away from me.
Soon everything will be taken away from me.
The rain, the clouds, and the soil that I walk on.
I'm going to practice.
alone, without a trace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my love for money.
For me, there was no other choice.
Beautifully blooming, in shimmering strands.
Sing beautifully about love, though.
The dream, which was never told.
As a dream, it was beautiful to have.
For him, who was banished from Eden.
Eden is one Eden after all.

I stand and look at the world through the gallbladder.
I can, I don't want to get away from the gallbladder.
It's so good to see life sink.
And he's throwing up these big bubbles into the gallbladder.
So painfully smooth and enticing are the sounds.
when laughter and singing come through the throat.
It lights up with asp and al and blossoms.
There's the dark brown branch above.
The healthy smell runs through the gallbladder.
And over the cliff, which is a magnificent swamp.
In each drop is a gem.
See how it glides wonderfully through the gallbladder?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are boats sailing there, and there are anglers.
with horn music and mouth singers.
And happy people in thousands.
We've been dragging them out to feast in the mountains and the valleys.
I want, I wanna, and I'm going to have to get out of here.
And drink life, if only for a minute.
I don't want to linger behind the wheel.
Forgiveness I will pray for.
It's the old, inexorably hard gallbladder.
It doesn't want to hide, it wants to be missing.
The silence in me is the stained and nitrated gallbladder.
And it's only when I break myself that the gallbladder breaks.

The west wind is going.
The West Wind.
It's going through the open window.
is floating around in the open book.
So it reads itself.
The Fernissan of the Year.
It dries faster now.
And at least one fly.
It's always there.
in the hardened, clear mass.
It's like a question.
out of that crystal-clear, empty, nocturnal space.
And the book reads itself.
Not without thought.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script was tiled and read quickly.
It was the cheapest in the wholesale trade.
And I discovered, at the age of 11, soon afterwards,
There wasn't much to be gained there.
Dreams of the houseplant.
And detective stories from the Riviera.
It was a remote country at the time.
But the name stuck.
Can you waste time?
And if you could.
Isn't that harmful to a single life?
Yet I know I've wasted my mouse's time.
The endless hours of boredom in school.
And that unifies the mediator who doesn't.
Not even the Minuteman wanted to move.
(Laughter) (Applause)
