the illusions existed; there were
denied; the sterile Rhenish sisters
with coercion at the mental hospital
stamped with tatters, marked
scented, threatened, to omen, omen
the outer reaches, about nothingness
is it a peasant in a mudflat outside the village
the lunar isolation
inundated, marked
blurred in characters, a hyenas to accompany
as she would talk to and nack, eat
flickering, flimmering there was
white flashing also there frost nets
descended ever deeper into the valley
remember that she isn’t dead until it’s
and dead lavender violet fingers, toes
the yellow teeth; flesh scabs; the water
mumbled, mumbling
fathers, mothers
daughters Ifigenia

It is most beautiful when it shimmers
All that love darkens the heavens
Lightly collected in a darkened light
Over the Earth,
Over the land the house
All is meekness All smeared with hands
The man himself wipes out distant beaches
All is near, all is far from
Everything is given
human beings borrowing
All is mine and shall be secluded from me
In short, everything will be chased from me
Tears, clouds, the ground where I walk
I shall wander –
alone with no trace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my love for cash,
there was nothing else for me to gain,
beautiful, In scorching strands,
beautiful when it comes to love.
That dream, which was never fulfilled,
as a dream it was beautiful to have,
for him, banished from Eden,
Eden is one Eden after all.

I stand and watch the world through the prism;
I can, I don’t want to get rid of the gallant,
it’s so good to see, how life declines
and chase tall bushes up to the hillock,
so painfully smooth and enticing it sounds,
when laughter and sorrow pass through the cauldron.
It sniffs brightly at asp and al and birch,
where on top the dark-coloured branch stands,
the healthy smell travels through the gallant.
And o’er the vine, which blessedly sowed,
in every drop is a precious gem,
see how it scintillates nicely through the gullet!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boats gallop by and anglers
with horn music and mute singers
and happy people in a thousand,
that blew forth to feasts in mountains and dells;
I will, I want to, shall, must go out
and drink life, if only for a minute,
I don’t want to drag myself behind the wheel!
Forgetting I’ll beg, I will rustle
the old inexorably solid gallant
– it doesn’t want to get tangled, or missing,
you in me are the infected and nineteenth gall,
and only when I myself am shattered, the gallant is smashed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
West Wind blows.
West Wind
through the open window
flutters in a book she’s folded up.
So it reads itself.
Fernissan over the years
dries faster now
and at least one fly
will always be there
in the stiffening, hardened mass.
Like a question
from the crystalline void of nocturnal space.
And the book reads itself
not without hindrance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the script was scrawny and could be quickly read.
It was the cheapest in the General Market
and I discovered, eleven-year-old, soon
that there was little to be gained.
Daydreams for the family tree
and detective stories from the Riviera
that was then a distant land.
But the name stuck;
Can time be traversed?
And if you could,
is that no harm to a single life?
Yet I know that I have wasted precious time.
The endless boring hours of school
and the enemy weatherman who doesn’t –
not even the watchman wanted to move.
