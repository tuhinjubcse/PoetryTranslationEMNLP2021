delusions were; renunciation
was; sterile Rhineland sisters
in mental hospital straight jackets
branded gypsy, marked
stenched, augured, to omen, omen
tractioned again, for naught
is it butterfly in the mud hut outside the village
the monthly isolation
banned, marked
bleeding in signs, a hen for company
to speak with and behead, eat
flickers, flickers were
white flickering also where frostnights
descended deeper into the valley
remember that she is not dead until warm
and dead lavender fingers, toes
the yellow tears; meat scraps; water
murmurs, murmuring
father, fathers’
daughters     Iphigenia

It is fairest in the gloaming air.
All the love the heavens bare
is collected in a dusky light
above the earth,
above the city light.
All is love, caressed by hands.
The Lord himself will vanish distant strands.
All is near, all is far away.
All is given
man for today.
All is mine, and all shall be taken away from me,
within moments all shall be taken away from me.
The trees, the clouds, the earth I face.
I shall wander—
alone, without a trace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased my love for money,
there was nothing else I could get,
sing angelic, you rasping strings,
sing angelic of lovers yet.
That dream, that never came true,
that dream was angelic to get,
for him, who is banished from Eden,
is Eden an Eden yet.

I stand and watch the world through iron bars;
I can, I must not release these iron bars,
it is so soothing to watch, how life abounds
and washes high waves against the iron bars,
so painfully bright and enticing it sounds,
when laughter and songs trickle through the iron bars.
Light shifts of aspen and alder and birch,
and above the precipice dark as pine,
fresh fragrances trickle through the iron bars.
And above the bay a majestic light,
within each drop an emerald shines bright,
watch, the divine glitter through the iron bars!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It abounds sail ships there and steamers too
with horn players and cheerful singers’ tunes
and thousands of joyous people wander,
cross country over hill and dale to feast;
I want, I want, I shall, I must escape
and taste life, if only for a single grape,
I must not vanish behind these iron bars!
In despair I shall bend, I shall scratch and batter
the old relentlessly hard iron bars
— they refuse to bend, they refuse to shatter,
for within myself I nailed and forged these iron bars,
and only once I shatter, shatter the iron bars.

The west wind blows.
The west wind
through the open window,
turning the pages of the open book.
As if to read itself.
The varnish on the oars
dries quicker now
and at least one fly
always gets stuck
in the hardening clear surface.
Like a question
from a crystal-clear, empty and nocturnal space.
And the book reads itself
not without afterthoughts.

The magazine was brick yellow and quickly read.
It was the cheapest thing in the company store
and I quickly discovered, at eleven years old,
that there wasn’t much to find there.
Daydreams for maids
and detective stories from the Riviera
which at that time was a distant land.
But the name stuck.
Can one kill time?
And if one could,
is that not a pity for an only life?
Still I know I have killed a great deal of time.
The endless boring hours in school
and the obstinate minute hand which never –
no, not even the minute hand wanted to move
