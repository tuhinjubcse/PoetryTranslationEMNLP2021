You, myself, dry like a defeated wind
who could only briefly hold in his arms
leaf that plucked from the trees
How can it be that nothing moves you
that there is no rain to keep you going or sun to shore up your weariness?
To be a purposeless transparency
over the clear lakes of your glances
oh tempest, deluge of long ago.
If ever since I seek your image that was only mine
if in my sterile hands I drowned the last drop of your blood and my tear
and if from then on the world was indifferent and the desert infinite
and every new night moss for the memory of your embrace
How in the new day will I have but your breath,
but your immovable arms between mine?
I mourn like a mother who has replaced the only dead child.
I cry like the earth that twice has felt the
the perfect and the same fruit.
I cry because it is you for my pain
and now I belong to you in the past.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today the star of your eyes did not shine.
A shipwreck of myself, moistened by the embrace of the waves,
I reach the sand of your body
in which my own voice names my name,
in which everything is gold and blue like a new day
and like hermetic thorns, perfect and silent.
In you my loneliness is reconciled
to think of you. It has all changed
the serene warmth of your glances
in fervid ripening of my life.
Slumber and fragile foam, my kisses
encode the universe in your eyelashes
—a beach of nakedness, land reached
that returns in glances your stars.
Why the lost flower
that withered your hopes, that Destiny scattered?
My offering is all yours in the seed
that were dried by the rays of your suns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This intense perfume of your flesh
is nothing more than the world moved by the blue globes of your eyes
and earth and the blue rivers of the veins that enclose your arms.
There are all the round oranges in your anguished kiss
sacrificed on the edge of a garden where life hung by all the centuries of mine.
How distant was the infinite air that filled our breasts.
I plucked you from the earth through the drunken roots of your hands
and I have drunk you all, oh fruit perfect and delicious!
Whenever the sun touches my flesh
I must feel the harsh touch of yours
born in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
nourished by the caress of your rivers as clear and pure as your embrace,
a gentle turn in the wind that blows
Comes from the mountains to your breath,
Mature in the sun of your eighteenth year,
warm for me who was waiting for it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a princess in her tower set,
with five shutters to look at life.
She is a sad goddess whose body was enclosed.
And your soul, that had flown before you died,
Is a magnificent wing, free from all weariness
You are not the phantom; I am the one!
What I understand of things! Things are offered to me,
not as they are of his, but as appear
to the five senses with which God confined
my coarse senses, my feeble perception.
You know it all today...; I, on the contrary, know nothing!
You are not the phantom; I am the one!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all the eternities
that preceded our world,
How can we deny that they already existed
planets with humanities;
and there were Homerics who described
the first heroic acts,
and there were Shakespeares who knew how to deepen
of the soul in the depths?
Snake that dies your tail,
inflexible circle, ball
black that you turn endlessly,
monotonous utterance of the same
song, tide of the abyss,
Are you a tale that will never end?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, the story wasn't that ephemeral
of our love: among the soft foliage
from the virginal book of your memory,
like a blue petal is the glory
grieving, noble and chaste of my verses.
You cannot forget me: I condemn you
to a stubborn memory. My love has been
the highest in your life, the best;
and only between the weeds and the mud
the pale lotus of oblivion rises.
You will see me everywhere: in the uncertain
Nightfall, in the blond dawn,
and when you work in the desert
as they tremble in your garden
the monotonous threads of rain.
And you will remember! That is the inheritance
that my pain gives you, that nothing excites you.
I will be a peak of light in your existence,
and an ineffable reproach in your consciousness
and an immortal stele within your soul!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A victory. It's too late, you didn't know.
Came like a lily to my bliss
the white waist that transcends
the motionless eternity of the earth,
pushing a feeble clear form
Until the clay is houred
with a white ray or a spur of milk.
Mute, compact darkness of the ground
in whose cliff
advances the clear flower
until the pavilion of its whiteness
defeats the base depths of the night
and of the clarity in motion
astonished seeds spill.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, this day was a full glass,
today, this day was the immense wave,
today, was the whole earth.
Today the stormy sea
lifted us up in a kiss
so high we tremble
in the lightning flash
and, tied up, we descend
to submerge ourselves without unlocking.
Today our bodies became extensive,
they grew to the limit of the world
and rolled as they melted
in a single drop
of wax or meteor.
Between you and me a new door opened
and someone, faceless as yet,
waited for us there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember in the middle of a triangle
a dwelling poppy
even silkier than silk
and with the scent of snakes.
The rest was bitterness
of corrated and gilded wheat.
I tied myself more than once
next to a joystickwith a camper apple
of open and sudden sex
and remained in the straw trembling
a scent of seed and moonlight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I speak not of sun, but of moon
that eternally illumines this poem
where a flock of children runs chased by wolves
and the verse tones a hymn to the pus
O impure love! Love of syllables and letters
that destroy the world, that soothe it
of being true, of having been there for nothing,
like a stream
that does not reflect my image,
mirror of the vampire.
of the one who, from the page
will drain your blood, reader
and turn it into tear and into nothingness:
and to make you merge with steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flower of the pomegranates:
engulf me and you will not love me.
How much you exaggerate the fragrance,
how extreme your rabble is,
flower that you paint with your eyes
and expose your soul to the sun!
Flower of the pomegranates.
One seemed to you
in the blubber with which you deceive,
and also because I had,
like you, black eyelashes.
Flower of the pomegranates.
One seemed to you...
And I only fear to see
your hand against mine:
Let me not dawn a day
in which you will become a woman!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I touched you last night and I have felt you
without my hand escaping beyond my own hand,
my body did not flee, nor did my hearing:
in an almost human way
I have felt you.
Palpitant,
I don't know if like blood or like a cloud
wandering,
through my house, dotted, darkness that rises,
darkness that falls, you run, sparkling.
You ran through my wooden house
you opened its windows
and I felt you thrust through the night,
daughter of the abysses, silent,
so terrible, so beautiful,
that all that exists,
for me, without your flame, it would not exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to hear a dream?
Well, last night
I saw the fleeting breeze of the thickness
that as they graze with the brooch
of a lily that rose in the meadow
grazed it with a kiss,
and then lost, swift and light,
of the branches among the thick foliage.
This is all my dream,
and if you want to understand it, beautiful girl,
binds your lips to my lips,
and you will know who he is and who she is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pride of love, I suffer from hunger for hearts.
Of doves, of storks, or of rabbits or lions,
There are no shrubs more tender, no more delicious,
I had already exhausted my claws and instinct,
When, erect on the almost outer rim of a plinth,
I was dazzled by a statue of an ancient emperor.
And I grew with enthusiasm; by the stone trunk
Ascended my desire like a brilliant hyenas
Up to the breast, apparently nourished on snow;
And I called to the impossible heart... sculpture
Its pure and serene glory guarded,
With forehead in Tomorrow and sole in Yesterday.
Perennial my desire, in the trunk of stone
He has been caught like a bloody hyenas;
And from then on I die dreaming a heart
Of statues, presage supreme for my beautiful claws;
It is neither flesh nor marble: a star paste
No blood, no warmth and no palpitation
With the essence of a superhuman passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time hasn't given you the answers,
only new questions.
Decline with the hours
the light, the streets unravel,
from your room you only see
a future of ragged branches,
the night snatched from the rooftops,
and you think you feel, even, that stillness
that precedes the snow
like an enclosed breath,
something that hopes to be
and desperate.
Winter
makes everything simpler,
with its fury of cold and dearth.
It's a discipline,
an agreement between the world and its opposite,
the half-light side on which it leans.
The color of the afternoon
is equal to thought.
It falls on the street
an enlightened light, almost extinct,
and everything recedes and falls asleep
as in a target,
as if the world were a chart of the earth,
a malnourished and effective map
that has given with the bone of things.
The mind is pleased in the winter.
It relieves him of his scabs,
its rare indifference,
the way it holds to what it has.
It simplifies everything,
these impatient questions too
that change over time,
that do not change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the smell of water
at the hour the earth enters the room:
a slow vapour that binds the air and leaves
a seed of happiness
on the skin:
the hours go by,
the rain does not send back,
the seed has turned to stalk
and twists around my body;
outside it rains, but a sun rises
before my eyes, which already forget
the conquered gray of rain:
a tree that offers light, not shadow,
under its branches
smiling, not knowing why I smile.
Blake left written that death
it was a simple change of room:
you go out, you enter, the house
is the same, the space
open in the morning
by this fragrance of grass
cut, by this coolness
clandestine that the air
puts on the eyes,
like that child on the train
contained the breath
as if saying look look
and laughed,
I can stop time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We weren't there when it happened.
We were on our way to another city,
another life,
under a shifting sky that moves with us.
We cross the fields green, yellow,
peoples of suspicions and impassive ravens,
and we never miss our home
or we feel nostalgia for the past.
That was the journey:
through the night silence,
to morning mist.
Once I found a leafy button in my pocket
and played at holding it under the sun,
throwing sparks at the high thorns.
Then it was a used coin
and we took the steady step on all the controls.
Europe's plains are a witness.
They also know something happened,
although we never saw it.
We were on our way to another country,
another life,
without bulky stretch marks,
without a place for memory.
Everything went in our wake,
now silence, then fog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things like this,
decided no more,
that the crackling of the sky was enough,
the deep grey of the cane-flowers.
"The gods are drowning in your house,"
Hearing it said, he smiled contentedly.
Birds in the hand, the silence of sand
of the hours, lime covering my eyes.
The wool of life melted into his tongue,
in the tentacular blood, and it was a weariness
serene, almost expert,
the root of snow tufted in his hand.
Everything travelled in a transient lane,
lights that shine or fade as the hours go by.
Restrained in the peace of these deserts,
for what books, I struggled,
and then: for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
flower of inconstancy.
I am the wood in which you crack,
the human stone in its rivulet,
The sedentary who pushes the seed,
your bridge pierced.
Find me.
I'm the one who turns back to make a shadow,
the one who claws and knocks; smoke
of the train of those who persecute you;
in the face of the empty blossoms,
in the middle of a dazzled diner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On this side of the Malecon stand out
the building lights and the street lamps of the coast
as if they were ships.
Sometimes a merchant ship or a cruiser sails out
of the port with all its lights on
and cross the sea.
Then one imagines the blinking lights
of the coast also turn into boats
and that houses and buildings move across the sea
and that the whole of Santo Domingo sets sail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold it burns
and makes those who await it tremble
the deaf passage of the tram
The elders bend down
the head in the glass
The tedium of living gnaws at their faces
The panes blur with glances
lost in their distant indifference
It is Sarajevo the sun
wraps itself in mortar fire
the ruins the façades
There is a transparency that weighs
the flight the course of the birds
Lump
the hills and the cliffs
fall on the Sniper Alley
Nothing amazes me now nor resigns me
if you say you're going
that you only know how to go
The waters of Miljacka
run suddenly aged
darken their footsteps beneath the bridge of Princip
Of a perfect shooting murdered
here to an Archiduche
We have died
until we starved many lives together
On the threshold of an Orthodox church
someone is watching how
the light of the candles goes out
Extinct already the thorns move
The chrysalis is empty
Welcome to hell advierten
graffiti of another time
There is nothing left of hell
but this slow calm
prolonged after it inhabits us
The cats howl in rubbish bags
The grass grows on stones in cemetery parks
He has crossed the highway leaving
the trembling of a thunderclap
of air behind the rails
perhaps a memory
nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trembled beside you as in a dream
I neither forget nor remember.
Winter sings and I move away from the others
newly born words:
we left under the bow of pain
where the two of us passed trembling
that I wove on your wings
so that you may order with your flight
the surrounding dirt
the chaotic loneliness it leaves.
The night is a lamp and lets the light
in a breath the oil of goodbyes.
In my rainy dream the shadows scream.
The implacable milestones of the future
come and go like compartments
like lukewarm tempests in a saltless sea
pyramids of tears.
I neither remember nor forget.
I twist the needle convulsing
let me free myself from your body
so that the weeds will pick you up
the transhumance of the day.
See us on your shore
rain that is in the rain
a synthesis of water
look at us how we are
see how we fall into this
a permanent prey of time
that which is life.
You advance between cotton wool, you think you see the sun
and suddenly you're struck by a sliver of air
and this void
armoured with instruments of torture.
Your fine blood flows from a circle
to enter another
as in an abyss intense and palpitating.
You advance as time recedes
and the genius of candor withdraws from the stubbornness.
Bird of fire, Liberians
of your frenetic roots.
Your hands cling to a corner of the sheets
at a point in destiny.
Rain breaks the rush of my dreams
pulls in the current of other days and sings
bleaching the black well of the afternoon.
I dream of a girl tangled in the air.
The rain sings in the heart of the seed
scrubs the earth and pulls up roots: words
newcomers.
As in a cosmic dance
Then comes the sun shining minute suns
yours are the children of mine
and we both play with the little ones
that will then illuminate you
Friend of the clouds
Daughter of rain.
Daughter of rain,
a garland of beautiful glances, suspended
within my eyes, examines the fire
your visions like flames
they cover my dream, a sun
of golden roots
climbs on your back,
my empty hand on your body
it wants to fill you
girl who comes from the full
to what you lack.
Before you my mother came to lean against my side
her body ignited in my blood
a flame of premonitions.
My mother took refuge in me
I was his island
to me came a sleeping sea
but my feet were burning.
I was overwhelmed by my mother
doubled its paths
dragged me like a shadow
on its shores.
She stretched out her eyes to me
and in a vision of fleeting fires
you, too, retreated, gathered together,
sap from our glances.
I was burning on my mother's face
I dreamt of a girl who weaves shipwrecks
it traced paths over water
to reach you, anticipated root
deep simultaneous journey
in my uninhabited body.
Now may my mother see me again
I am its forge
embrace slow pupils that meet
in a dream that burns.
I dream of a girl tangled in the air.
This
is not a poem. You advance in a dream
of turbid waters
the lamp turns over again
and the fire spills
your eyes so good at looking inside me
they kindle distant fires.
Fire defines outlines of water
drops dissolve into a bottom
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental sky, empty.
I search for hexagonal words
a prism opens on the page, it's missing
who writes the remaining steps.
Your sleeping hands upon my chest
open and close my books.
The sentinel of our dream is a slumberer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red Centaur of golden horns grows,
Bloody clouds burn the mountain rock copper.
The sea soothes the endless dream, the fog whips
With wicked splendours.
The sunset now imposes itself, like a miracle, and sick
The loneliness of postcards.
The wild wing among the branches
Break its flight with wild violet,
The distant pupil then tries to return.
Astonished at the secret words that time
He would find in stone or in snow,
Twilight is a golden god in a dark world.
I open my eyes and roam the desert
From its magnificent sands.
I am not twilight, but in me is its splendor.
Giant towers rise above the gray grass.
The sea lights its stained glass windows.
Through the burning walls the colour of my eyes rises,
The horizon trembles on marble yellow as the hair
Of a woman,
Mirrors and screens are stained with splendor
Trees with their ancient songs on the branches.
Who can be happier at this hour when the sky sleeps
And dreams of magicians and miracles?
Among the ashes of the afternoon tigers are reborn
That when night comes they die with their eyes fixed on the sea.
Look at the landscape where you will die one day,
Under this radiance of a hundred swords you will find
The last face,
The terrible colors, the endless beauty of dreams
Of those who do not dream, scattered on the beaches,
And thou wilt see my face inflamed
And you will love my music
And you will place this fiery flower in your breast.
The mortal lips will tell your name in splendor
In words, William Turner.
