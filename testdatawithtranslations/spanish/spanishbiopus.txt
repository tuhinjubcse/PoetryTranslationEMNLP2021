You, me, dry as a defeated wind
who could not but very briefly hold in his arms a
leaf that sprouted from the trees
How can anything change you?
that there is no rain to trouble you, nor a sun to quench your fatigue?
To be transparent without object
on the clean lakes of your gazes
Oh, tempest, flood long ago.
If ever since then I've been looking for your image that was only mine
If in my sterile hands I drowned the last drop of your blood and my tears
And since then the world has been indifferent and the desert infinite.
and every new night musgo for the memory of your embrace
How in the new day will I have but your breath,
but your impalpable arms among mine?
I cry like a mother who replaced her dead only son.
I cry like the earth that has felt twice sprouting the
Perfect fruit and itself.
I cry because it's you for my duel
and I already belong to you in the past.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today you didn't look like the star of your eyes.
Naufrago of myself, wet from the wave embrace,
I'm coming to the sand of your body
in that my own voice calls my name,
in which everything is gold and blue as a new day
and like the hermetic, perfect, silent spikes.
In you my loneliness is reconciled
She's all moved away to think of you.
the serenity of your gazes
in fervorous maturity my life.
Hard liquor and flakes, my kisses
cifran el universo en tus pestañas
—play of nakedness, land reached
that brings your stars back into your eyes.
To what the lost flower
Who left your expectation, who dispersed Destiny?
My offering is all yours in the seed
that dried out the rays of your sunshine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This intense perfume of your flesh
It's nothing but the world that flies and moves the blue balloons in your eyes
And the earth and the blue rivers of the veins that squeeze your arms.
There are all the round oranges in your angry kiss
sacrificed on the edge of a garden in which life was suspended for all the centuries of mine.
How remote was the infinite air that filled our breasts.
I ripped you out of the earth by the drunk roots of your hands
And I drank you all, O perfect and delicious fruit!
As long as the sun feels my flesh
I must feel the ruddy contact of yours
born in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
nursed in the care of your clear and pure rivers as your embrace,
sweet turn in the wind than in afternoons
comes from the mountains to your breath,
ripened in the sun of your eighteenth year,
It was warmer for me than I expected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a princess in her tower,
with five advantages to look at life.
She's a sad goddess whose body has been squeezed.
And your soul, that since before you died,
It's a magnificent wing, free of all trace...
You're not the ghost: it's me!
Things are offered to me,
not as they are of their own, but how they appear
to the five senses God limited
my gross sensory, my diminished perception.
You know everything today; I don't know anything!
You're not the ghost: it's me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all eternities
that preceded our world,
How to deny that they already exist
planets with humanities;
And there were Homers who described
the first heroic acts,
And there were Shakespeares who drowned.
of the soul in the depths?
Serpent that bite your tail,
inflexible circle, ball
black you're spinning,
monotonous remark of the same
chant, tide of the abyss,
Are you a never-ending story?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it wasn't that ephemeral history.
of our love: among the thin folios
the virgin book of your memory,
# As a blue petal is glory #
doliente, noble and caste of my verses.
You can't forget me: I condemn you
to a tense memory.
the highest thing in your life, the best thing;
and only between the leeches and the hundred
The pale lotus of forgetfulness rises.
You'll see me wherever: in the unknown
At night, in the rubbish,
And when you work in the desert
corredor, mientras tiemblan en tu huerto
the monoton threads of the rain.
That's the inheritance.
that gives you my pain, that nothing soothes you.
I will be a summit of light in your existence,
and an ineffable reproach on your conscience
and an immortal talisman within your soul!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's late, you didn't know.
It came as a spur to my will
the white tallea that passes
the eternal standstill of the earth,
pushing a weak form clear
till hour the clay
with white lightning or milk spoon.
Move, compact darkness of the soil
on whose cliff
The clear flower advances
until the pavilion of its whiteness
defeat the unworthy backdrop of the night
and clarity in motion
The seeds are soaked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, this day was a full cup,
Today, this day was the immense wave,
Today, it was all over the land.
Today the tempestuous sea
He lifted us up in a kiss
so high that we tremble
in the light of a lightning
and, tied up, we descended
to sink unscathed.
Today our bodies have become extensive,
grown to the limit of the world
and rolled to the brink
in a single drop
wax or meteor.
Between you and me, a new door opened
and someone, still without a face,
He was waiting for us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember in the middle of a trigal
a purple pope
even siltier than silk
and with a snake scent.
The rest was misery.
Corn wheat and gold.
I hooked up more than once
next to a pickpocket with a field apple.
of open and sudden sex
And he just stood there shaking
a smell of semen and moon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not talking about the sun, but the moon.
that eternally illuminates this poem
where a pack of children runs chased by the wolves
and the verse plays a pus anthem
Love of syllables and letters
that destroy the world, that relieve it
If it's true, if I'm there for nothing,
like a stream
that doesn't reflect my image,
Vampire mirror.
of that, from the page
It's gonna suck your blood, reader.
and turn it into tears and nothing:
and to make you commute with the steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flor de las adormideras:
screw me and don't want me.
How much the scent exaggerates,
how extreme your reef,
flower that makes you eyebrows
and breathe your soul into the sun!
Flor de las adormideras.
You liked one.
in the blush you deceive,
and also because he had,
like you, black eyelashes.
Flor de las adormideras.
One of them seemed...
And I'm just trembling to see
Your hand on mine:
Let it not dawn one day
When you become a woman!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last night I touched and felt you
without my hand fleeing beyond my own hand,
without my body fleeing, nor my ear:
in an almost human way
I felt you.
Palpitante,
I don't know if it's blood or cloud.
errante,
by my house, in stripes, darkness rising,
Darkness coming down, you're running, screaming.
You ran through my wooden house
your windows opened
and I felt you beat the whole night,
daughter of the abysses, silent,
so terrible, so beautiful
that everything that exists,
For me, without you, I wouldn't exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to hear a dream?
Well, last night
I saw the fleeting breeze of the thimble
that when I stroke the brooch
of a lily rising in the meadow
He recorded a "kiss" on him,
lost afterwards rauda and light
of the sprinkle between the thick foliage.
This is my dream all,
And if you want to understand, beautiful girl,
Join your lips in my lips,
and you will know who he is, and who she is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fierce of love, I am starving of hearts.
Of doves, vultures, corks or lions,
There's no shortage of taste, no gracefulness,
I had already strayed my claws and my instincts,
When she stands on the almost outer edge of a plough,
I was struck by a statue of an ancient emperor.
And I grew enthusiastic by the trunk of stone
My desire grew like a cloud of ivy
Even the chest, grounded in snow apparently;
And I called the impossible heart... the sculpture
His glory guarded serenely and purely,
With the forehead tomorrow and the plant yesterday.
Perennial my desire, on the log of stone
It is burned with bleeding ivy;
And since then I've been dying dreaming of a heart
Of statue, prey adds to my fair clasp;
It's neither meat nor marble: a star paste
No blood, no heat and no heartbeat...
With the essence of an over-human passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time hasn't given you the answers,
Just new questions.
Decline with the hours
the light, the streets spread,
From your room you only see
a future of graying branches,
the night gathering on the roofs,
and you think you even feel that quiet
that precedes snow
as a contented breath,
something he expects to be
and despair.
Winter
makes it all simpler,
with his cold and short temper.
It's a discipline,
an agreement between the world and its reverse,
the side of darkness on which it rests.
The color of the evening
is equal to thought.
Falling over the street
a clear light, almost exante,
and everything goes away and fades
like on a target,
as if the world were a diagram of a world,
a malnourished and effective map
He's found the bones of things.
The mind is pleased in the winter.
It relieves her barbeque,
their rare indifference,
The way he sticks to what he has.
It simplifies things.
also these impatient questions
that change over time,
They don't change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the smell of water
at hourdar the earth enters the room:
slow steam that connects air and leaves
a seed of joy
on the skin:
pasan las horas,
rain does not send,
The seed has become a stem
and it folds round my body;
It's raining outside, but a sun is rising
before my eyes, you've forgotten
the gray of the rain:
tree that offers light, not shadow,
under their branches
I smile, not knowing why.
Blake wrote that death
It was a simple change of room:
Come in, the house.
is the same, space
open morning
for this smell of grass
cut off, by this freshness
clandestine than air
puts on the eyes,
Just like that kid on the train
held the breath
like saying, "Look, look,
and laughing,
I can stop time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We weren't there when it happened.
We were on our way to another town,
another life,
under a changing sky that moved with us.
We crossed green fields, yellow,
peoples of suspicious people and treacherous crows,
and we didn't ever miss our house
or we feel nostalgic for the past.
So was the journey:
in the night silence,
in the morning snow.
I once found a tinted button in my pocket.
and I played to hold him under the sun,
Throwing flashes at the high spikes.
Then it was a used coin
And we made it through all the checkpoints.
The plains of Europe are witnesses.
They also know that something happened,
even if we never saw him.
We were on our way to another country,
another life,
without thick bulkheads,
no place for memory.
Everything was going our way,
Now silence and then fog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's how it is.
decided that no more,
that she was sufficient with the crepitar of heaven,
the gray bottom of the canary trees.
"The gods bow down in your house,"
He heard it said, and smiled pleased.
Birds in hand, sand silent
of the hours, the dust opening your eyes.
The oble of life was founded on his tongue,
in the tentacular blood, and it was a tiredness
sereno, almost expert,
the root of snow brushed in his hand.
Everything was traveling on a transient lane,
lights that glow or turn out at times.
Retired in the peace of these deserts,
What books, he refuted,
And then: for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incontinence flower.
I'm the wood in which you peel,
the human stone in his kidney,
the sedentary who pushes the grain,
your bridge crossed.
Meet me.
I'm the one who turns to make shadow,
the one who gnaws and beats; smoke
of the train of those who chase you;
in front of the empty vase,
at the center of a dazzling dining room.

From this side of the malecón are distinguished
the lights of buildings and headlamps on the coast
as if they were ships.
Sometimes a merchant ship or a cruiser leaves
of the port with all its lights on
and across the sea.
Then one imagines the flashing lights
of the coast are also transformed into ships
and that houses and buildings move by the sea
and that whole of Santo Domingo goes sailing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold it burns
and shakes who awaits
the deaf passing the tram
The elders cling
the head on glass
The tediousness of living is upon their faces
They paint the glasses with glances.
lost their distant indifference
It's Sarajevo the sun
fits in with mortar fire
the ruins the façades
There's a transparency that hurts.
the flight the path of the birds
Lontane
the hills and the acecho
falling over Sniper Alley
Nothing ever bothers me or resigns me.
if you say you're leaving
That you just know to leave
The waters of the Miljacka
They run quickly aged
darken their way under the bridge of Principe
From a perfect shot they were murdered.
Here's an Archiduck.
We're dead.
So many lives together
On the threshold of an Orthodox church
Someone watches how
candle light is consumed
Extinct already the tits are moving
The kirostatis is empty
Welcome to hell advierten
graffiti from the past
Hell is gone
but this slow calm
prolonged after he inhabits us
Cats pound in garbage bags
Grass grows on cemetery gravestones
He crossed the tram leave
an estruendo the temblor
of the air behind the wheels
Maybe a memory
Nothing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risen beside you like in a dream
I don't forget or remember.
Sing the winter and I stand apart from the others
new words:
the ones we leave under the bow of sorrow
Where we both passed shaking
the ones that licks on your wings
for you to order your flight
surrounding mud
the chaotic loneliness that desolates.
The night is a lamp and pours
in one blow the oil of the goodbyes.
In my rainy dream the shadows shout.
The implacable milestones of the future
They come and go like comparsas
like warm storms in a salty sea
cry pyramids.
I don't remember or forget.
Enhebro la aguja convulsa
Let me get rid of your body.
I'll pick you up.
the trash of the day.
Wait for us on your shore
rain that is in the rain
water synthesis
Look at us how we are.
See how we fall into this.
a permanent prey of time
This is life.
You walk among cottonwoods, you think you see the sun.
and suddenly you're surprised by a puff of air
and this emptiness
amoblado con instrumentos de tortura.
Your fine blood flows from a circle
to enter another
as in an intense and palpitant abyss.
You advance as time slows down
and the genesis of candor withdraws from the star.
Bird of fire, release us
of your frenetic roots.
Your hands cling to a corner of the sheet
to a point of fate.
Rain franches the backdrop of my dream
drag the current of other days and sing
whitening out the black pit of the afternoon.
I dream of a girl stranded in the air.
Rain sings in the heart of the seed
it sows the earth and ripens the roots: words
newcomers.
Like in a cosmic dance
Then comes the sun setting tiny suns
Yours are children of mine
And we both played with those little ones.
Then they'll light you up.
Friend of the Clouds
Rain-daughter.
Mother of the rain,
collar of beautiful eyes, stop.
Into my eyes, examine the fire
your visions as you call them
They hang my dream, a sun
of golden roots
Get up on your back,
My hand is empty on your body
He wants to fill you.
You're a full-on girl.
to what you're missing.
Before you came my mother to stand on my side
His body burned in my blood
a fire of premonitions.
My mother was staying with me
I was his island.
to me came a drenched sea
But my feet were burning.
I was hanging on to my mother
duplicate their paths
He dragged me like a shadow
by its banks.
She was widening her eyes to me
and in a vision of burning fires
You lay down, too, gathered,
savia from our gazes.
I burned on my mother's face
I dreamt of a girl who teats ships
He traced paths on water
to come to you, root early
hondo viaje simultáneo
in my uninhabited body.
Now my mother is fond of me again
I'm his buffer.
embrace slow pupils that meet
in a dream that burns.
I dream of a girl stranded in the air.
This.
It's not a poem.
of shaken waters
the lamp turns again
and the fire pours out
your eyes so apt to look inside me
They're setting up fogatas far away.
Fire defines water contours
drops disperse in a background
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental sky, empty.
I'm looking for hexagonal words
a prism opens over the page, missing
who writes the remaining steps.
Your numb hands on my chest
Open and close my books.
The centinela of our dream is a sleeping one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red centaur of gold horns grows,
Bloody clouds burn the majestic copper of the mountains.
The sea suffocates the endless sleep, the fog gnaws
With evil splendours.
The sun sets, like a miracle, and I'm sick.
The loneliness of postalels.
The wild wing among the branches
Break his flight with wild violet,
The distant pupil then tries to return.
Incredible in the secret words that time
Bed on the stone or in the snow,
The Twilight Zone is a god of gold in a dark world.
I open my eyes and brace the desert
From their magnificent sands.
I'm not the Twilight Zone, but in me is its splendor.
On the gray grass are rising giant towers.
The sea lights its vials.
Through the burning walls, the color of my eyes rises,
Shake the horizon over the yellow marble like the scalp
Of a woman,
Empaña de esplendor los espejos y los recios
Trees with their old chants on the branches.
Who can be happier at this time of night
And you dream of magicians and miracles?
From the ashes of the evening, tigers are reborn
When the night comes, they die with their eyes fixed on the sea.
Look at the landscape where you're gonna die one day,
Under this glow of a hundred swords you will find
The last face,
The terrible colors, the infinite beauty of dreams
Of those who don't dream, dispersed on the beaches,
And you'll see my face lit up
And you'll love my music
And you will place this fire flower on your chest.
The dead lips will say your name with ferocity
In the words, William Turner.
