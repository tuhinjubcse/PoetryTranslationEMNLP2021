You, myself, dry as a defeated wind
that he could only very briefly hold in his arms one
a leaf that plucked from the trees
How is it possible that nothing moves you
There's no rain to hold you down and no sun to give you a hard time?
Being an objective transparency
on the clear lakes of your eyes
Oh tempest, long ago's drizzle.
If since then I've been looking for your image that was only mine
If in my sterile hands I drowned the last drop of your blood and my tears
And if it has been since then indifferent the world and infinite the desert
And every new night I musk for the memory of your embrace
How in the new day will I have but your breath,
but your unwavering arms among mine?
I cry like a mother who has replaced the only son who died.
I cry like the earth that has felt twice germinate the
fruit perfect and same.
I cry because it's you for my grief
And I belong to you in the past.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The star in your eye didn't win today.
A wreck of myself, moist from the embrace of the waves,
I come to the sand of your body
in which my own voice calls my name,
in which everything is golden and blue like a new day
And like hermetic, perfect, silent spikes.
In you my solitude is reconciled
to think of you.
the serene warmth of your eyes
In fervent maturity of my life.
Algae and fragile foams, my kisses
encrypt the universe in your tabs
â€”naked beach, land reached
that returns your stars in glances.
Why the lost flower
that your waiting has gone, that Destiny has scattered?
My offering is all yours in the seed
that the rays of your suns have dried.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This intense perfume of your flesh
It's nothing but the world that moves the blue balloons of your eyes
And the earth and the blue rivers of the veins that cling to your arms.
There are all the orange circles in your anguish kiss
sacrificed at the edge of a garden where life was suspended for all the centuries of mine.
How remote was the endless air that filled our breasts.
I ripped you from the earth by the drunken roots of your hands
And I've drunk all of you, oh perfect and delicious fruit!
As long as the sun touches my flesh
I must feel the rough touch of yours.
born in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
nourished in the caress of your clear and pure rivers as your embrace,
Sweet turn on the wind that in the afternoons
It comes from the mountains to your breath,
matured in the sunshine of your eighteenth year,
warm to me who was waiting for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a princess in her castle,
with five advantages to look at life.
She's a sad goddess that the body imprisoned.
And your soul, which had been flying since before you died,
It's a magnificent wing, free from all wear and tear...
You're not the ghost. I am.
What an understanding of things! Things are offered to me,
not as they are of his, but as appear
to the five senses with which God limited
my gross senses, my perception diminished.
You know everything today... I, on the other hand, know nothing!
You're not the ghost. I am.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all eternities
who preceded our world,
How to deny that they already existed
planets with humans;
and there were Homers who described
the first heroics,
And there were Shakespeares who knew how to drown
of the soul in the depths?
Snake you bite your tail,
inflexible circle, ball
black that you turn endlessly,
monotone refrain of the same
singing, tide of the abyss,
Are you saying it's never gonna end?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it wasn't that ephemeral.
of our love: among the thermal folios
from the virginal book of your memory,
As a blue petal is the glory
tender, noble and chestly of my verses.
You can't forget me: I condemn you
to a stubborn memory. My love has been
the highest in your life, the best;
and only between the lowest and the highest
The pale lotus of oblivion springs up.
You'll see me anywhere, in the uncertainty.
Evening, in the red mist,
And when you work in the desert
walker, as they tremble in your garden
The monstrous threads of the rain.
And you'll remember, that's the inheritance.
that gives you my pain, that nothing soothes.
I will be the summit of light in your existence,
and an ineffable reproach in your conscience
And an immortal spark within your soul!

It's late, you didn't know.
He came as a scoundrel to my obedience.
the white heighs that passes
the unmoving eternity of the earth,
pushing a weak clear form
until the clay is hardened
with white lightning or milkspoon.
Soft, compact soil darkness
in whose crypt
The clear flower advances
until the pavilion of its whiteness
defeats the unworthy background of the night
and of the moving clarity
They shed dull seeds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, this day was a full drink,
today, this day was the immense wave,
Today, it was the whole earth.
Today the stormy sea
He raised us in a kiss
so high that we tremble
in the light of a lightning bolt
And, tied down, we descended
to sink without unleashing.
Today our bodies became extensive,
grew to the limit of the world
and they rolled and melted
in a single drop
of wax or meteor.
Between you and me, a new door opened.
And someone, faceless yet,
He was waiting for us there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember in the middle of a triangle
a purple poplar
even more thirsty than silk
and with the scent of snake.
The rest was the asperity.
of the wheat that is ripe and golden.
I hooked up more than once.
next to a shredder with a field apple
of open and sudden sex
And he was in the swinging straw
a smell of semen and moon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't talk about the sun, but the moon.
that eternally illuminates this poem
where a herd of children is chased by wolves
And the verse sings a hymn to the pus
Oh impure love, love of syllables and letters
that destroy the world, that lighten it
Of being true, of being there for nothing,
Like a stream
that doesn't reflect my image,
vampire mirror.
of the one who, from the page
He's gonna suck your blood, reader.
and turn it into tears and nothing:
And to make you cough up the steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flor de las adormideras:
You trick me and you don't want me.
How much the aroma exaggerates,
how extreme your rear end,
Flower that you paint eyes
and exhale your soul to the sun!
Flor de las adormideras.
One looked like you
in the roar with which you deceive,
and also because I had,
Like you, black eyelashes.
Flor de las adormideras.
One looked like...
And I only tremble to see
your hand on mine:
"Tiemblo do not dawn a day"
in that you become a woman!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last night I touched you and I felt you
without my hand fleeing beyond my hands,
without my body fleeing, nor my ear:
in an almost humane way
I've felt you.
Palpitant,
I don't know if it's like blood or like a cloud.
errant,
by my house, in dots, darkness rising,
Darkness descending, you ran, screaming.
You ran into my wooden house.
You opened his windows.
And I felt you lying there all night,
daughter of the abyss, silent,
Warrior so terrible, so beautiful
that all that exists,
for me, without your flame, it wouldn't exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You want to hear a dream?
Well, last night.
I saw the leaky breeze of thickness
that when the brooch rustles
of a lily that rose in the meadow
recorded a "bee" over him,
Losing afterwards rough and light
of the ridge between the thick foliage.
This is my whole dream,
And if you want to understand, beautiful child,
Bind your lips to my lips,
and thou shalt know who he is, and who she is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pride of love, I'm hungry for hearts.
Of pigeons, of fowls, or of hornets or lions,
There's no manjar that tastes more tender, no more gracious flavor,
I'd already ruined my claws and my instincts,
When he stands on the near-shore of a plinth,
I was blinded by a statue of an ancient emperor.
And I grew with enthusiasm; for the log of stone
Ascended my desire like a fulminant hyadra
Even the chest, apparently nurtured in snow;
And I called the impossible heart... the sculpture.
His glory guarded serenely and purely,
With the front in tomorrow and the back in yesterday.
Perenne mi deseo, en el tronco de piedra
He's been chained up like bloody hyadra;
And since then I've been dying dreaming of a heart
Of statue, prey sum for my beautiful claw;
It is neither meat nor marble: a star paste
No blood, no heat and no palpitations...
With the essence of a superhuman passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time hasn't given you the answers,
Just new questions.
Decline with the hours
The light, the streets are fading,
From your room you only see
a future of everlasting branches,
the night gathered on the rooftops,
and you think you feel, even, that stillness
that precedes the snow
as a contented breath,
something that expects to be
and desperate.
Winter
It makes everything simpler,
with his burly of cold and deficiency.
It's a discipline,
an agreement between the world and its reverse,
the dark side on which it rests.
The color of the afternoon
is equal to thought.
It falls on the street
a bright, almost extinguished light,
and everything goes away and falls asleep
as in a goal,
as if the world were a world diagram,
a malnourished and effective map
who has given with the bone of things.
The mind is pleased in the winter.
It relieves your beard,
their strange indifference,
the way he sticks to what he's got.
Everything simplifies,
also these impatient questions
that change over time,
that don't change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the smell of water
At the time the earth enters the room:
slow steam that connects the air and leaves
a seed of joy
on the skin:
passing the hours,
the rain does not remit,
The seed has become stalk
and it curls around my body;
Outside it rains, but a sun rises
before my eyes, which already forget
the faded gray of the rain:
tree that offers light, not shade,
under their branches
Smile, don't know why smile.
Blake left it written that death
It was a simple change of room:
You come in, you go out, the house
It's the same, space
open in the morning
for this smell of grass
cut, by this cooler
clandestine that the air
puts in the eyes,
Just like that kid on the train.
contained the breath
Like saying, "Look, look,
and laughed,
I can stop time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We weren't there when it happened.
We were on our way to another city,
another life,
under a changing sky that moved with us.
We cross green, yellow fields,
peoples of suspicions and stubborn crows,
And never did we miss our home
or we feel nostalgia for the past.
That was the journey:
for the night's silence,
in the morning it's foggy.
I once found a folding button in my pocket.
And I played holding him in the sun,
Throwing sparks at the high spikes.
Then it was a used coin.
And we got the clear pass on all the controls.
The plains of Europe are witness.
They also know that something happened,
Even though we never saw him.
We were on our way to another country,
another life,
without stubborn bulk,
No place for the memory.
Everything was coming our way,
Now silence and then fog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's the way it is,
decided that no more,
that all he needed was the crack of the sky,
the grey depths of the ravines.
"The gods will bow down in your house,"
he heard say, and smiled contentedly.
Birds in the hand, the silence of sand
of the hours, the lime covering the eyes.
The obsession of life melted into his tongue,
in the tentacular blood, and it was a tiredness
serene, almost expert,
the snow-capped root in his hand.
Everything traveled on a transient track,
lights that glow or go out according to the time.
Retired in the peace of these deserts,
for which books, he argued,
and then: for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
flower of inconstancy.
I am the wood you cling to,
the human stone in his kidney,
the seed-bearer,
your bridge crossed.
Find me.
I'm the one who turns to make shadow,
that beats and hits; smoke
from the train of those who persecute you;
Stupid in front of the empty flowerpot,
in the middle of a dazzling dining room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From this side of the malecon you can distinguish
the lights of buildings and lighthouses from the coast
as if they were ships.
Sometimes a merchant ship or a cruise ship comes out
of the port with all its lights on
and cross the sea.
Then one imagines that the sparkling lights
of the coast are also transformed into ships
and that houses and buildings move by the sea
and that the whole of Sunday is set aside for sailing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold burning
and makes those who await it tremble
the deaf passage of the tram
The elderly clink
the head in the glass
The tediousness of living comes to their faces
They smear the glasses with glances
Lost in their distant indifference
It's Sarajevo the sun
matches mortar fire
the ruins the facades
There's a transparency that hurts
the flight the direction of the birds
Luton
the hills and the pasture
falling over the Sniper Alley
Nothing amazes me anymore nor resigns me
If you say you're leaving
You only know how to leave
The waters of the Miljacka
They're suddenly getting old.
Darken their passage under the bridge of Princip
From a perfect shot they killed
here's an archduke
We're dead.
I've had a lot of lives together.
On the threshold of an Orthodox church
Someone's watching how
the candle light is consumed
Extinct already the teas are moving
The kirostatis is empty.
Welcome to hell advierten
graphite from another time
There's no hell left.
But it's slow and steady.
prolonged after it inhabits us
Cats steal in garbage bags
The herb grows on gravestones in cemetery parks
He's crossed the tram stop.
A whirlwind the thunder
of the air behind the rails
Maybe a souvenir.
Nothing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staring at you like in a dream
I don't forget or remember.
The winter sings and I'm apart from the others
newborn words:
those we leave under the bow of pain
where we've both been shivering
The ones I made on your wings
so you can order your flight
the surrounding mud
the chaotic loneliness that desponds.
The night is a lamp and come
in a blow the oil of goodbyes.
In my rainy dream the shadows scream.
The implacable milestones of the future
They come and go like compartments
Like warm storms in a saltless sea
Pyramids of crying.
I don't remember or forget.
I twist the convulsive needle
Let me get rid of your body
so I can pick up the weeds for you.
transhumance of the day.
Wait for us on your shore
rain that is in the rain
water synthesis
Look at us how we're doing.
See how we fall into this.
a permanent prey of time
This is life.
You walk among the cottonwoods, you think you see the sun
And suddenly you're surprised by a puff of air
and this emptiness
Equipped with instruments of torture.
Your fine blood flows out of a circle
to get into another
as in a deep and palpitating abyss.
You advance while time recedes
and the genius of candor withdraws from the stern.
Firebird, liberate us.
of your frenetic roots.
Your hands are clinging to a corner of the sheet
to a point of destiny.
The rain breaks the hold of my dream
drags the flow of other days and sings
whitening the black well of the afternoon.
I sleep with a girl tangled in the air.
The rain sings in the heart of the seed
carve the earth and root it out: words
newcomers.
Like in a cosmic dance
Then comes the sun, breaking tiny suns
Yours are my children
And we both played with those little ones
Then they'll light you up.
Friend of the clouds
Rain girl.
Rain child,
Beautiful-looking necklace, stop.
inside my eyes, examine the fire
your visions as you call them
They fill my dream, a sun
of golden roots

My hand was empty on your body
He wants to fill you up.
You're a full-fledged girl.
to what you lack.
Before you my mother came to lean on my side
His body burned in my blood
a fire of premonitions.
My mother was staying with me.
I was his island
Even to me came a sleepy sea
But my feet were burning.
I was hung up on my mother.
He doubled his paths
dragged me like a shadow
on its shores.
She stretched her eyes out to me
and in a vision of fleeting fires
you were resting, too, gathered,
saved from our gazes.
I burned on my mother's face
I dreamed of a girl who weaved shipwrecks
Draw paths over the water
to come to you, early root
long trip simultaneous
in my uninhabited body.
Now my mother's looking at me again.
I'm his frat.
embrace slow pupils that gather
in a dream that burns.
I sleep with a girl tangled in the air.
This.
It's not a poem.
of troubled waters
the lamp turns again
and the fire melts
Your eyes so apt to look inside me
They start fires far away.
Fire defines water contours
drops falling from a bottom
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental, empty sky.
I look for hexagonal words
a prism opens on the page, missing
who writes the remaining steps.
"Your hands resting on my chest."
Open and close my books.
The centine of our dream is a sleeper.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red centaur of golden horns grows,
Bloody clouds burn the copper stone of the mountains.
The sea soothes the endless sleep, the fog heals
With evil splendors.
The darkness is already imposed, like a miracle, and sick
The loneliness of the postcards.
The wild wing among the branches
Break your flight with wild violet,
The distant pupil then tries to return.
Incredible in the secret words that time
It nestles in the stone or the snow,
The twilight is a golden god in a dark world.
I'll open my eyes and brave the desert
From its magnificent sands.
I am not the twilight, but in me is its splendor.
Giant towers rise above the gray grass.
The sea lights its stained glass windows.
Through the burning walls the color of my eyes rises,
Tilt the horizon over the yellow marble like a scalp
From a woman,
The mirrors and the glasses are full of splendor.
Trees with their old singing on the branches.
Who can be happier at this time when the sky is asleep
And he dreams of magicians and miracles?
From among the ashes of the afternoon tiger are reborn
When night comes, they'll die with their eyes fixed on the sea.
Look at the landscape where you'll die one day,
Under this glow of a hundred swords you will find
The last face,
The terrible colors, the endless beauty of dreams
Of those who do not dream, scattered on the beaches,
And you'll see my face lit up
And you'll love my music
And you'll put this fire flower in your chest.
The mortal lips will say your name with fulgor
In words, William Turner.
