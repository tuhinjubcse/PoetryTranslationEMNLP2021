You, myself, dry like a defeated wind
who could only briefly hold in her arms
leaf that ripped from the trees
how can it be that nothing moves you
that there is no rain to spur you on, no sun to drive your fatigue?
To be a pointless transparency
over the clear lakes of your glances
O tempest, deluge of long ago.
If since then I search for your image that was only mine
if in my sterile hands I drowned the last drop of your blood and my tear
and if since then the world has been indifferent and the desert infinite,
and every new night I spit for the memory of your embrace
how on this new day will I have but your breath,
but your implacable arms between mine?
I cry like a mother who has replaced the only dead child.
I cry like the earth that has felt two times germinate the
the perfect and same fruit.
I cry because it is you for my grief
and now I belong to your past.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today the star of your eyes did not weep.
A shipwrecked self, wet from the embrace of the waves,
I come to the sand of your body
in which my own voice mentions my name,
in which everything is gold and blue like a new day
and like hermetic thorns, perfect and silent.
In you my solitude is reconciled
to think about you. Everything has changed
the serene warmth of your glances
in ferocious ripeness of my life.
Fragile algae and foams, my kisses
encode the universe in your eyelashes
— beach of nudity, achieved land
that sends back your stars in glances.
For what lost flower
that withered your hope, that scattered Destiny?
My offering is all yours in the seed
that were dried by the rays of your sun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This intense perfume of your flesh
is nothing more than the world that moves the blue globes of your eyes
and the earth and blue rivers of the veins that press your arms.
There are all the round oranges in your anguish kiss
slaughtered on the edge of a garden in which life suspended itself for all the centuries of mine.
How remote was the infinite air that filled our breasts.
I ripped you from the earth by the drunken roots of your hands
and I have drunk all of you, oh perfect and delicious fruit!
As always when the sun touches my flesh
I must feel the rough touch of yours
born in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
nourished by the caress of your rivers clear and pure as your embrace,
a gentle turn in the wind that blows
Comes from the mountains to your breath,
Mature in the sun of your eighteen years,
warm for me who waited for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a princess set in its tower,
with five shutters to look at life.
She is a sad goddess whose body oppressed.
And your soul, that from before your death was flying,
Is a magnificent wing, free from all encumbrances
You are not the ghost: I am the phantom!
What do I understand about things! Things are offered to me,
not as they are his, but as appear
to the five senses with which God limited
my coarse sensing, my feeble perception.
You know it all today...; I, in contrast, know nothing!
You are not the ghost: I am the phantom!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all eternities
that preceded our world,
How can one deny that once they existed
planets with humanities;
and there were Homeros who depicted
the first heroic acts,
and there were Shakespeares who knew how to deepen
of the soul in the depths?
Snake that dies your tail,
inflexible circle, ball
black that you constantly rotate,
monotonous refrain of the same
song, tide of the abyss,
Are you a tale of never ending?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, not so ephemeral was the story
of our love: among the polished leaves
from the virginal book of your memory,
Like a petal of blue is the glory
grieving, noble and chaste of my verses.
You cannot forget me: I condemn you
to a tenuous memory. My love has been
the highest thing in your life, the best;
and only between the slime and mud
the pale puddle of oblivion rises.
You will see me anywhere: in the uncertain
nightfall, in the blonde dawn,
and when you work in the desert
corridor, while they tremble in your garden
the monotonous threads of rain.
And you will remember! That is the inheritance
that gives you my pain, that calms nothing.
I will be a peak of light in your existence,
and an ineffable reproach in your conscience
and an immortal stele within your soul!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A victory. It's late, you didn't know.
Came like a lily to my whiteness
the white waist that pierces
the immobile eternity of the earth,
pushing a clear weak form
until the clay wears out
with a white ray or a spur of milk.
Mute, the compact darkness of the soil
on whose cliff
the bright flower advances
until the flag of its whiteness
defeats the unworthy depths of the night
and of the moving clarity
spilled astonished seeds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, this day, was a full glass,
today, this day, was the immense wave,
today, was all the earth.
Today the stormy sea
lifted us in a kiss
so high we tremble
in the lightning flash
and, tied, we descend
to sink without unleashing.
Today our bodies became extensive,
grew to the world's limit
and they wheeled as they merged
in a single drop
of wax or meteor.
A new door opened between you and I
and someone, without a face as yet,
awaited us there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember in the midst of a triangle
a native poplar
even silkier than silk
and with the smell of a snake.
The rest was asperities
of the corrated and golden wheat.
I kneeled more than once
next to a trill-wheelerwith a country-corn
of sudden, open sex
and stayed trembling in the straw
an odour of seed and moonlight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not speak of the sun, I speak
that eternally illuminates this poem
where a herd of children runs chased by wolves
and the verse adds a hymn to the kiss
O amor impuro! Amore of the syllables and the letters
that destroy the world, that alleviate it
of being certain, of just being there for nothing,
like a brook
that does not reflect my image,
mirror of the vampire.
of the one who, from the page
will suck your blood, reader
and turn it into tear and into nothing:
and make you kneel with the steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flower of the pomegranates:
entangle me and do not love me.
Whenever you exaggerate the fragrance,
how much you exaggerate your anguish,
flower you paint your eyes
and expose your soul to the sun!
Flower of the pomegranates.
One of them seemed to you
in the blush with which you deceive,
and also because I had,
like you, black eyelashes.
Flower of the pomegranates.
One did seem to you...
And all I fear is to see
your hand placed on mine:
I hope that one day it won't dawn
when you become a woman!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last night I touched you and I felt you
without my hand escaping beyond my own hand,
without my body fleeing, or my hearing:
in an almost human way
I have felt you.
palpitating,
I don't know if like blood or like a cloud
wandering,
through my house, dotted, darkness that rises,
darkness that falls, you ran, sparkling.
You ran through my house of timber
you opened its windows
and I felt you thrust through the night,
daughter of the abysses, silent,
so terrible, so beautiful,
that everything exists,
for me, without your flame, would not exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to hear a dream?
For it is night
I saw the brief breeze of the thickness
that when you dash your brow
of a lily that blossomed in the meadow
A "little bee" scribbled on top of it,
losing itself afterwards swiftly and lightly
of the budding plants among thick foliage.
This is all my dream,
and if you want to understand it, beautiful girl,
join your lips to my lips,
and you will know who 'he' is and'she'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fierce with love, I suffer from hunger for hearts.
Of doves, or vultures, of ravens or lions,
There is no trick that tempts more, no more welcome taste,
I had already worn my claws and my instinct,
When raised in the almost outer reaches of a plinth,
I was dazzled by a statue of an old emperor.
And I grew with enthusiasm; by the stone trunk
My desire ascended like a sapphire lightning
Up to his breast, apparently nourished on snow;
And I shouted to the impossible heart... the sculpture
His glory guarded most serene and pure,
With my forehead in Tomorrow and my sole in Yesterday.
Perennial my desire, in the stone trunk
It has become stuck like bloody ivy;
And from then on I die dreaming of a heart
Of statue, presumption for my beautiful throat;
It is neither flesh nor marble: a starry paste
Without blood, without heat, and without palpitation...
With the essence of a superhuman passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time has not given you answers,
only new questions.
Decline with the hours
the light, the streets turn dark,
from your room you only see
a future of ragged branches,
the night snatched up on the rooftops,
and you feel, even, that calmness
that precedes the snow
like a contented breath,
something that hopes to be
and desperate.
The winter
makes everything simpler,
with its burly of cold and carelessness.
It's a discipline,
an agreement between the world and its reverse,
the half-light side on which it leans.
The color of evening
is equal to the thought.
It falls on the street
an enlightened light, almost extinct,
and everything recedes and goes to sleep
as in a goal,
as if the world were a diagram of the earth,
an unfed and effective map
that has given with the bone of things.
The mind rejoices in the winter.
relieves his belly,
its rare indifference,
the way it holds on to what it has.
Simplifies everything,
these impatient questions, too,
that change with time,
that do not change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the smell of water
at the hour the earth enters the room:
a slow vapour that joins the air and leaves
a seed of happiness
in the skin:
the hours go by,
the rain does not return,
the seed has become sown
and twists round my body;
outside it rains, but a sun rises
before my eyes, which already forget
the conquered grey of the rain:
tree that offers light, not shadow,
under its branches
I smile, and I don't know why.
Blake left it written that death
it was a simple change of room:
you come, you enter, the house
is the same, the space
open in the morning
by this scent of grass
cut by this freshness
clandestine that the air
puts in the eyes,
like that child on the train
contained the breath
as if saying look look
and was laughing,
I can stop time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We weren't there when it happened.
We were on our way to another city,
another life,
beneath a shifting sky that moved with us.
We cross green, yellow fields,
villages of suspicious people and impassive ravens,
and not once do we miss our home
or we feel nostalgia for the past.
So was the journey:
through the night silence,
to the morning mist.
Once I found a piece of paper in my pocket
and I tried to hold him in the sun,
sprinkling sparkles on the high thorns.
Then it was a worn coin
and we took our step in all the controls.
The plains of Europe are witness.
They also know that something happened,
although we never saw it.
We were on our way to another country,
another life,
without strident bumps,
without a place for memory.
Everything came in our wake,
now silence and then fog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such are the things,
decided that no more,
that the crackling of the sky was enough,
the deep grey of the cannae.
«The gods run rampant in your house,»
he heard them say, and smiled in delight.
Birds in my hand, the silence of sand
of the hours, lime filling our eyes.
The chalice of life was melting in his tongue,
in the tentacular blood, and it was exhaustion
Serene, almost expert,
the root of the snow tucked away in his hand.
All was moving on a transient rails,
lights that shine or go out depending on the time.
Dragged into the peace of these deserts,
for what books, I refuted,
and then: for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
flower of inconstancy.
I am the wood in which you crack,
the human stone in its rivulet,
The sedentary pushing the seed,
your bridge crossed.
Find me.
I am the one who turns to make shadow,
the one who beats and knocks; smoke
of the train of those who persecute you;
in front of the empty flower pot,
in the middle of a dazzled dining room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On this side of the malecón stand out
the lights in the buildings and the streetlamps on the coast
as if they were ships.
Sometimes a merchant ship or cruiser sails
of the port with all its lights turned on
and crosses the sea.
One imagines then the blinking lights
of the coast also turn into boats
and houses and buildings move across the sea
and that the whole of Santo Domingo sets to sail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold it burns
and makes the one who waits for it tremble
the deaf footstep of the tram
The elders bend
the head in the glass
Life's tedium cracks their faces
They blur the glasses with glances
lost in their distant indifference
It is Sarajevo the sun
it fits into the mortar firing squads
the ruins the façades
There is a transparency that weighs
the flight the course of the birds
Distant
the hills and the cliff
fall over the Sniper Alley
I am no longer surprised or resigned
if you say you're leaving
that you can only go
The waters of Miljacka
run, suddenly aged,
darken her footsteps beneath the bridge of Princip
With a perfect firing squad murdered
here to an Archiduque
We have died
until the heart attack many lives together
On the threshold of an Orthodox church
someone is watching how
the light of the candles is extinguished
Extinct now the oaks stir
The chrysalis has been emptied
Welcome to hell advierten
graffiti from another time
From hell nothing remains
but this slow calm
prolonged since it inhabits us
The cats scurry in trash bags
The grass grows in cemetery park carvings
He has crossed the tram leaving
a trembling thunderclap
of the air behind the rails
Perhaps a memory
nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trembling beside you as in a dream
neither forgetfulness nor memory.
Winter sings and I distance myself from the others
newly born words:
we left under the arch of pain
where the two of us pass by trembling
which I wove on your wings
so that you may order with your flight
the surrounding clay
the chaotic loneliness it relieves.
The night is a lamp and lights up
in one breath the oil of goodbyes.
In my rainy dream the shadows cry out.
The implacable milestones of the future
come and go like comparsas
like warm storms in a salt-less sea
pyramids of sorrow.
I do not remember or forget.
I twist the convulsing needle
let me free myself from your body
so that the clay covers you
the transhumance of the day.
Espéranos on your shore
rain that is in the rain
water essence
let's see what we're like
see how we fall into this
a permanent prey of time
that which is life.
You move among cotton wool, you think you see the sun
and suddenly a palette of air surprises you
and this void
bandaged with instruments of torture.
Your fine blood springs from a circle
to enter another
like in an intense and palpitating abyss.
You advance as time recedes
and the genius of candor withdraws from the estrus.
Bird of fire, Liberans
of your frenzied roots.
Your hands cling to a corner of the sheets
at one end of destiny.
Rain shatters the remanso of my dream
drags the current of other days and sings
whitening the black well of evening.
I dream of a girl tangled in the air.
The rain sings in the heart of the seed
scrubs the earth and pulls up roots: words
recent arrivals.
As in a cosmic dance
the sun then comes shining minute suns
yours are children of mine
and we both play with the little ones
that will then light up you
Friend of the clouds
Daughter of the rain.
Daughter of the rain,
a necklace of beautiful glances, detente
within my eyes, examines the fire
your visions like flames
cover my dream, a sun
of golden roots
climbs over your back,
my hand empties over your body
wants to fill you
girl who comes from the full
for what you lack.
Before you came my mother to lie on my side
her body ignited in my blood
a blaze of omens.
My mother was lodging in me
I was his island
to me came a sleeping sea
but my feet were burning.
I was overwhelmed by my mother
It doubled its roads
dragged me like a shadow
along its shores.
She rolled her eyes on me
and in a vision of fleeting fires
you too, reunited, recoiled,
sap from our glances.
I burned on my mother's face
I dreamt of a girl who weaves shipwrecks
drew paths across the water
to reach you, anticipated root
deep simultaneous journey
in my untenanted body.
Now my mother finds herself again in me
I am its flag
embrace slow pupils that meet
in a dream that burns.
I dream of a girl tangled in the air.
This
is not a poem. You are advancing in a dream
of disturbed waters
the lamp turns again
and fire spills over
your eyes so apt to look inside me
kindle distant fires.
Fire defines water contours
drops dissolve into a bottomless
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental, empty sky.
I seek hexagonal words
a prism opens on the page, missing
who writes the remaining steps.
Your sleeping hands upon my chest
open and close my books.
The sentinel of our sleep is a slumberer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red Centaur grows with golden horns,
Bloody clouds burn the mountains' bed of copper.
The sea smothers the endless dream, the fog heals
With wicked splendors.
The sunset is imposed, like a miracle, and sick
The loneliness of postcards.
The wild wing among the branches
Breaks its flight with wild violet,
The distant pupil then attempts its return.
Enraptured by the secret words that time
I would dream in stone or in snow,
Twilight is a golden god in a dark world.
I open my eyes and browse the desert
From its magnificent sands.
I am not the twilight, but in me is its splendor.
Giant towers rise above the gray grass.
The sea lights up its windows.
Through the burning walls the colour of my eyes rises,
The horizon flickers on the marble yellow like the locks of hair
Of a woman,
Damp with splendour the mirrors and the stark
Trees with their old songs in the branches.
Who can be happier at this hour when the sky sleeps
And dreams of magic and miracles?
Among the ashes of the afternoon tigers are born again
That when night comes they die with their eyes fixed on the sea.
Look at the landscape where you will die one day,
Beneath this splendor of one hundred swords you will find
The last face,
The terrible colors, the infinite beauty of dreams
Of those who do not dream, scattered on the beaches,
And thou shalt see my face aflame,
And you will love my music
And place this fiery flower in your breast.
The mortal lips will say your name in splendor
In words, William Turner.
