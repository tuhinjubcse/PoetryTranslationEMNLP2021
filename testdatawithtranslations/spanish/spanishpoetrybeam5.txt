You, myself, dry like a condemned wind
that she could but very briefly hold in her arms a
a leaf that was torn from the trees
how can it be possible that nothing can move you
that there is no rain that tires you nor a sun that will lend to your fatigue?
To be a transparent nought
over the clean lakes of your glances
oh tempest, a drought from long ago.
If since then I seek your image that was only mine
if in my sterile hands I drowned the last drop of your blood and my tear
and if it was since the world was indifferent and infinite
and each new night I sweat for the memory of your embrace
how in the new day will I have but your breath,
but your implacable arms between mine?
I cry like a mother who has rescued the son who had died.
I cry like the earth that twice has felt it sprout
the perfect and the same fruit.
I cry because I am you for my pain
and I already belong to the past.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today the star of your eyes did not tear.
Naufrago of myself, dank from the embrace of waves,
I come to the sand of your body
in which my own voice calls my name,
in which everything is golden and blue like a new day
and like the hermical twigs, perfect and hushed.
In you my loneliness is reconciled
to think about you. It's all changed
the serene heat of your glances
in fervid maturity my life.
Alga and fragile spume, my kisses
the universe in your eyelashes
—play of nakedness, reached earth
that returns your stars in glances.
Why does the lost flower
that your hope was vanquished, that fate dispersed?
My offering is all yours in the seed
that dried up the rays of your suns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This fragrant perfume of your flesh
is nothing but the world that moves and shifts the blue globes of your eyes
and the earth, the blue rivers of veins that punish your arms.
There are all the round oranges in your anguished kiss
sacrified at the edge of a garden where life was suspended throughout all the centuries of mine.
How remote was the infinite air that filled our breasts.
I took you out of the earth by the drunken roots of your hands
and I have drunk you all, oh the perfect fruit and delicious!
Now whenever the sunlight touches my flesh
I will feel the harsh contact of yours
named in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
with the caress of your clear and pure rivers like your embrace,
a sweet change in the wind that at evening
come from the mountains to your breath,
grown in the sun of your ten years,
that was warm for me who was waiting for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a queen in her tower bound,
with five ventancities to see life.
It is a saddened goddess whose body caught fire.
And your soul, that from before you died,
is an excellent wing free from all strain...
You are not the ghost: it is I!
How do I know things! Things are offered to me,
not as they are theirs, but how they appear
to the five senses with which God limits
my coarse sense, my diminutive perception.
You know it all...; however, I dont know anything!
You are not the ghost: it is I!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all the eternities
that preceded our world,
how can we negare that they existed already
Earths with humanities;
and Homer men wrote
the first heroic acts,
and there were Shakespeares who were able to grasp
of the soul into the depths?
Serpent that kills your tail,
inflexible circle, ball
that spins endlessly,
the monotonous refrain of the same
sing, sea of the abyss,
Are you a tale to never end?...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, not so efficacious was the story
of our love: among the polished foliage
of the virginal book of your memory,
like a blue petal the glory
the grieving, noble and chaste of my verses.
You cannot forget me: I condemn you
to a tenacious memory. My love has been
the highest point in your life, the best;
and only among the lambs and the mud
the pallid loom of forgetting.
You'll see me everywhere: in the uncertain
nightfall, in the golden dawn,
and when you labor in the desert
as they tremble in your garden
the rhythmic threads of the rain.
And you will remember! That is the heritage
that gives you my pain, that nothing calms you.
I will be a pillar of light in your existence,
and an ineffable reproach from your conscience
and an immortal slash within your soul!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A victory. It’s late, you didn’t know.
She came as a surprise to my delight
the white figure that pierces
the motionless eternity of the earth,
ing a faint clear shape
and the clay begins to rust
with a white ray or a spoon of milk.
Mute, compact darkness of the soil
on whose cliff
the bright flower advance
until the pavilion of its whiteness
the disgusting deeps of the night
and of the motion of light
the seeds are shaken with awe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, this day, was a full cup,
Today, this day, was the immense wave,
, it was all the earth.
Today the storm-driven sea
she lifted us in a kiss
so high that we tremble
at the lightning flash
and, embracing, we descended
to submerge us without disillusion.
Our bodies became enormous,
they grew to the limit of the world
and they rolled on burning
in a single drop
of wax or meteor.
between you and I opened a new door
and someone, without a face yet,
there it was waiting for us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember in the midst of a trigal
a purple poplar
even more silky than silk
and with the scent of a serpent.
The rest was assuagement
of golden and corrred wheat.
I knelt more than once
at the side of a triller with a flagelan apple
of sex open and sudden
and it stayed trembling in the straw
a scent of seed and moon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I speak not of the sun, but about the moon,
that illuminates eternally this poem
where a pack of kids runs chased by the wolves
and verses carve into a symphony
O impurous love! Love of syllables and of letters
that destroy the world, that relieve it
Of being certain, of being there for nothing,
like a stream
that does not reflect my image,
a mirror of the vampire.
of him who, from the page
will suck your blood, reader
and turn it into a tear and nothingness:
and to make you twine with steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The flower of the poppies:
entangle me and dont love me.
How much the excessive fragrance,
how extreme your scramble,
that you paint your dark circles
and exhale your soul in the sun!
The flower of the poppies.
A young girl appeared to you
in the madness with which you deceive,
and because he had,
like you, black lashes.
The flower of the poppies.
A young girl appeared to you
And I am afraid to see
your hand placed in mine:
The day you shall love me,
in which you will become a woman!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I touched you and felt you
without my hand fleeing beyond my hands,
without my body fleeing, or my hearing:
of a very human way
I have felt you.
Pal,
I don't know if it's blood or cloud
wandering,
through my house, pointed, darkness that rises,
darkness that rises, you ran, sparkling.
You went by my house of timber
your windows opened
and I felt you beat the whole night,
she of the abysses, silent,
a warrior so terrible, so beautiful
that all that exists,
for me without your flame, I would not exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to hear a dream?...
For yesterday
I saw the fleeting breeze of the forest
that as you brush with the broom
of a lily that rose up in the meadow
It grabbed a 'white' from the sky,
lost perdiéndose después, rauda y ligera
of the swirling fountain among the crimson foliage.
This is my dream all,
and if you want to understand it, lovely girl,
your lips joined to my lips,
and you will know who he is, and who she.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fier Fier fierce of love, I am starving of hearts.
Of doves, of vultures, or ants,
There is no shrub that holds more, no gratifying savor,
It had already been wrecked my claws and my instinct,
When standing in the ultratier of a plinth,
A statue of an old emperor flash’d me.
And I grew enthusiastic; through the trunk of stone
I fell in love like shining ice
Up to her breast, fed of snow as it seems;
And I clapped to impossible heart... the sculpture
His glory she guarded serenely and pure,
With his brow in Mañana and his feet yesterday.
Perennial my desire, in the trunk of stone
It has been severed like bloody dew;
And from then on I die dreaming a heart
Of statue, a prey for my fair throat;
It's neither flesh nor marble: a pasta of stars
Without Without without blood, without warmth and without palpation...
With the essence of a superhuman passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time The time time Time Time,
only new questions.
The hour ticks down
the light, the streets fade,
from your room you only see
a future of gray branches,
the night draped over the roofs,
and you believe that even that quietness
that precedes the snowfall
like a content breath,
that it hopes to be
and desperately needs it.
The winter
makes everything simpler,
with its fury of coldness and carelessness.
It is a discipline,
a pact between the world and its reverse,
the side of darkness on which he rests.
The colour of the evening
is the same as thought.
It falls onto the street
A light bright, almost outcast,
and everything is away and slumbering
like in an objective,
as if the world were a drawing of the earth,
a nutritious and effective map
that has given up the bone of things.
The mind is pleased in winter.
It relieves its belly,
its rare indifference,
the way he holds on to what he has.
It simplifies everything,
And these indifferent, intrepid questions
that change with time,
that do not change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the smell of water
in the cradle of the earth enters the room:
a slow wave that joins the air and leaves
a seed of happiness
in the skin:
the hours pass,
the rain does not come back,
the seed has grown like a log
and wraps itself around my body;
it rains outside, but a sun rises
my eyes, that they've forgotten
the scorched gray of the rain:
that offers light, not shade,
under its branches
I smile without knowing why.
She left written that death
It was a simple change of room:
you go inside, you enter, the house
is the same, space,
open open opened in the morning
by this odor to grass
cut by this coolness
that the air
sets in their eyes,
like that child from the train
he held out his breath
like saying, look, see,
and she laughed,
I can make time stop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We were not there when it happened.
We wandered along the road to another city,
another life,
under a shifting sky that moved with us.
We walked green fields, yellow,
villages of subtle people and impassive trunks,
and never did we neglect our house
or we feel nostalgia for the past.
So was the journey:
through the night silence,
at dawns fog.
Once upon a time I found a button of lattice in my purse
and I tried to hold it back under the sun,
to the lofty twigs blowing sparks.
Then it was a used coin
and we had the frantic passing through all controls.
The plains of Europe are a witness.
They know also that something went wrong,
even if we never saw it.
We travelled along the road to another land,
another life,
without clumsy bulbs,
without a place for memory.
All went up our way,
And then silence and then fog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the things,
he decided, no more,
that it would suffice the sky's crepitar,
the deep gray of the cañaverales.
"The gods roar in your house",
he heard her say, and smiled cheerful.
Birds in her hand, the silence of sand
of hours, the lime enclosing our eyes.
The oble of life was mixed in his tongue,
in the tempestuous blood, and it was a weariness
Serene, almost expert,
the root of snow retown in his hand.
All was traveling in a transient lane,
light lights that shine or shut off by the hours.
Retired in the peace of these deserts,
for what books, I argued,
and then: for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inconstant flower.
I am the wood on which you spit,
the human stone on its rill,
the gardener pushing the seed,
your pierced bridge.
Come closer to me.
I am the one who turns to make shadow,
the one who bites and gets beaten; smoke
of the train that pursues you;
parched before the empty flower,
at the center of a dazzling dining room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From this side of the mattress they distinguish
The lights of the buildings and the lighthouses on the shore,
as if they were ships.
At times a mercant ship or a cruise ship sails
of the port with all its lights buttoned up
and travels the sea.
Then one imagines the blinking lights
of the shore also transform into boats
and houses and buildings move to the sea
and that the whole Santo Domingo is swept to sail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold that burns
and makes a frightened man shiver
the restless transcription passes
The elderly bend
the head in the glass
The tedium of living surrounds their faces
They cover the glasses with glances
lost in their distant indifference
Its Sarajevo the sun
is cut into the gunshots of mortar
the ruins the façades
There is a disgraceful transparency
the flight the rumour of the birds
Lontano
the hills, and at the slope
they fall over Sniper Alley
Nothing Nothing nothing amazes me or gives up
if you say you're leaving
that you only know how to go
The Miljackas water
they run suddenly older
they darken their passage under the bridge of Prince
From a perfect shot they murdered
here to an Archiduque
We have died
and many lives have been together
On the threshold of a Catholic church
a stranger notices how
the light of candles is consumed
Extinct already, the teas move
The kirostatis has remained empty
Welcome Welcome, they warn
of another time
From hell nothing remains
but this slow calm
long after it surrounds us
The cats hurl in baggies of debris
The grass grows on gravestone parks,
The train has crossed the lane
an echo of the trembling
from the air after the rills
perhaps a memory
nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It shines beside you like in a dream
not forgetting or remembering.
The winter sings and apart from the others
newborn words:
that we leave under the arc of pain
through which we two passed trembling
that I wove in your wings
so that with your flight you can set things
the surroundings
the caótica solitude that disintegrates.
The night is a lamp and a witness
in a sip from the oil of goodbyes.
In my feverish slumber the shadows scream.
The implacable deeds of tomorrow
they come and go like comparts
like warm tempests in a sea of salt
pirouettes of tears.
I do not recall nor forget.
I gain the convulsed needle
that frees me from your body
so I can pick up the earthly good
of the day.
We meet on your shore
that is in the rain
the synthesis of water
look at how we are
See how we fall into this
a constant catch of time
that which is life.
You walk among cotton threads, think you see the sun
and suddenly you're greeted by a splash of air
and this emptiness
with instruments of torture.
Your fine blood spills over a circle
to enter another
like an immense and palpitating abyss.
You advance as the time slips past
and the myth of candor withdraws from the depths.
A bird of fire, let us drink
of your frenzy roots.
Your hands cradle at a corner of the sheets
to a point of destiny.
The rain franches the remanso of my dream
the current of another days and sings
whitening the black well of evening.
I dream of a girl entangled in the air.
The rain sings in the heart of the seed
ashes the earth and tears up roots: words
new arrival.
Like in a cosmic dance
Then comes the sun, shining minute suns
yours are the children of mine
and we both play with those little ones
that then they'll light up you
A friend of the clouds
She of the rain.
She of the rain,
a collar of beautiful glances, detached
within my eyes, examine the fire
your visions like flames
they rise from my dream, a sun
of golden roots
climbs up to your back,
my empty hand rests on your body
to fill you
girl who comes from the full
to what you lack.
My mother came to stretch before you
her body ignited in my blood
a blazing fire of premonitions.
My mother was crying in me
I was his island
I came to a sleepy sea
but my feet were burning.
I was covered by my mother
it duplicated its roads
it drag me like a shadow
on its shores.
She extended her eyes towards me
and in a vision of fleeting fires
you rested yourself together, reunite,
the sapphire of our glances.
I blazed on my mothers face
I was dreaming of a girl who woves shipwrecks
I traced paths on the water
to reach you, an anticipatory root
the deepest simultaneous voyage
in my uninhabited body.
Now my mother sees herself again in me
I am his forge
a slow-breasted embrace of pupils that gather
in a dream that burns.
I dream of a girl entangled in the air.
That
is not a poem. You advance into a dream
of dissolved waters
the lamp turns over again
and the fire spills
your eyes so good at seeing inside me
they light distant fogatas.
The fire defines water
the drops slide down into a depth
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental sky, empty.
I seek hexagonal words
a prism opens over the page, we lack
who counts the remaining steps.
Your adorned hands over my chest
and close my books.
The centinel of our dream is a sleeping man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red centaur of golden horns grows,
Bloody clouds scattering from the mountains.
The sea suffocates the endless slumber, melts the mist
With misguided blossoms.
The sunset imposes itself, like a miracle, and sickly
The solitude of the postcards.
The wild wing among the branches
He shakes his flight with wild violet,
The distant eye then seeks its return.
Increasing in the secret words that time
It would nestle in stone or snow,
The twilight is a god of gold in a dark world.
I open my eyes and the desert swarms
From their splendid sands.
I am not the twilight, but in me is its splendor.
On the grass the giant towers rise.
The sea ignites its vitrales.
By ardent walls the color of my eyes ascends,
The horizon flickers over the brown marble like the hair
Of a woman,
The splendour of the mirrors and the sharpened
Plants with their ancient songs on the branches.
Who can be happier at this hour when the sky sleeps
And dreams of magicians and miracles?
From the ashes of evening, tigers are born again
That at night they die with fixed eyes on the sea.
Look at the landscape you will die in one day,
Under this splendour of a hundred swords you'll find
The last face,
The terrible colors, the infinite beauty of dreams
Of those who do not dream, scattered on the beaches,
And you will see my face inflamed
And you will love my music
And you will place this fiery flower in your breast.
The mortal lips will say your name with lightning
In the words, William Turner.
