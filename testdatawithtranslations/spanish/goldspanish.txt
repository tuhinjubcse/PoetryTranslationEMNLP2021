You, myself, dry like a defeated wind
which only for a moment could hold in its arms the leaf
it wrenched from the trees,
how is it possible that nothing can move you now,
that no rain can crush you, no sun give back your weariness?
To be a purposeless transparency
above the limpid lakes of your gaze,
oh tempest, oh deluge of long ago!
If since then I seek an image of you that was mine alone,
if within my sterile hands I stifled the last drop of your blood and my tears,
if since then the world has been indifferent,
in wastelands endless, and each new night
has grown like moss over the memory of your embrace,
how then in the new day can I have any breath but yours,
any but your impalpable arms among mine?
I weep like a mother who has replaced her only dead son.
I weep like the earth which twice has felt the same perfect fruit sprout with it.
I weep because you were destined to be my grief
and already now it is in the past that I belong to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today your eyes have lost the stars they wore
And I am shipwrecked too and wan with waves
Who swim out unto your body’s far shore
Where my own voice can call the name I bore,
Where there is gold and azure, day that’s new,
Grainlike and ripe, perfected, silent too.
In you my solitude once more seeks grace—
In thought of you! This swift change which seeps o’er,
some muted passion which your glances wore
Have touched with fiercer fire my life a space.
Fast-fleeting, far, far foam—seaweed—my kiss
Could worlds create again across your eyes!
Naked the shore there, lone, but rich for bliss,
And back the stars would blaze where bleakness lies.
A flower—and made to bloom for ruin vainly!
A world of joy and dead by fate’s decree?
My gift—all fruit-ripe, grain—rich things to be
Which bitter suns like yours seek surely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This intense perfume of your flesh
is nothing more than the world which the blue spheres of your eyes move and displace,
nothing more than the earth and the blue rivers of veins imprisoned in your arms.
In your anguished kiss are all the round oranges
you sacrificed on the edge of a garden where life for all time to come broke off from mine.
So remote was the endless air that filled our breasts.
I pulled you from the earth by the drunken roots of your hands,
and entire I drank you down, oh perfect delicious fruit!
Forever now when the sun touches me
I must feel the rude contact of your flesh
born in the freshness of an unexpected dawn,
nourished in the caress of rivers as pure and clear as your embrace,
sweetened in the afternoon wind
that comes down from the mountains to join your breath
and ripened in the sun of your eighteen years,
warm for me who awaited it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My soul is a princess in her tower closed
gazing on life through five little windows.
She is a mournful goddess prisoned by the body.
And your soul, which flew before you died,
is a brilliant wing, thoroughly freed...
You are not the ghost; the ghost is I!
What do I understand of things! To me, things offer
not what they truly are, but how they appear
to the five senses with which God holds at bay
my bulky sensorium, my tenuous perceiving.
You know all today... I, rather, know nothing!
You are not the ghost; the ghost is I!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In all the eternities
that preceded our world,
how can we refuse to believe that there have already
been other planets with human beings,
whose Homers have declaimed
their first heroic deeds
and whose Shakespeares have shared wisdom gleaned
from delving into the depths of the soul?
Serpent biting your tail,
uncompromising circle, black
ball that turns without ceasing,
monotonous refrain of the same song,
abysmal tide—
is this story of yours ever to have an end?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, the story of our love was not
so ephemeral: among the smooth folios
of the virginal book of your memory,
as blue petals are the suffering, noble
and caste-like glories of my verses.
"You cannot forget me; I condemn you
to a tenacious souvenir. My love
has been the highest point of your life,
the best; and only between the mud and
the smile, there surges the pale lotus of the forgotten.
"You will see me wherever, in the uncertain
nightfall, in the golden dawn;
and when you labor in the deserted corridor,
while the monotonous threads of rain
tremble in your orchard.
"You will have to remember! This is my inheritance
that my pain has given you,that nothing is spellbound.
"You will be at the lighted top of your existence,
and an ineffable reproach in your conscience 
and an immortal trail inside your soul!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victory. It has come late, I had not learnt
how to arrive, like the lily, at will,
the white figure, that pierces
the motionless eternity of earth,
pushing at clear, faint, form,
till the hour strikes: that clay,
with a white ray, or a spur of milk.
Shedding of clothing, the thick darkness of soil,
on whose cliff
the fair flower advances,
till the flag of its whiteness
defeats the contemptible deeps of night,
and, from the motion of light,
spills itself in astonished seed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This day, Today, was a brimming glass.
This day, Today, was an immense wave.
This day was all the Earth.
This day, the storm-driven ocean
lifted us up in a kiss
so exalted we trembled
at the lightning flash
and bound as one, fell,
and drowned, without being unbound.
This day our bodies grew
stretched out to Earth’s limits,
orbited there, melded there
to one globe of wax, 
or a meteor’s flame.
A strange door opened, between us,
and someone, with no face as yet,
waited for us there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, in the wheat-field’s centre
one purple poppy
even more silken than silk
and with a snake’s aroma.
The rest was the roughness
of cut and golden wheat.
I have been tangled there, more than once
beside a thresher with a wild apple
opened by sex and sudden
and in the threshed straw remained
an odour of semen and moon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not speak of the Sun, but the moon
that lights up forever this poem
where a herd of children is persecuted by the wolves
and verse sings a hymn to the pus.
Oh impure love! Love of the syllables and the letters
that destroy the world, that relieve it
of be true, be there for nothing,
as an stream
that does not reflect my image,
mirror of the vampire.
of that, since the page
goes to suck your blood, reader
and converted into tear and nothing:
and do you commune with the steel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flower of drowsiness,
lull me but love me not.
How you profuse your perfume,
how overdo your rouge,
flower who kohl your lids
and exhale your soul in the sun!
Flower of drowsiness.
There is one resembles you
in your deceiving blush,
and too because she has
black eyelashes like you.
Flower of drowsiness.
One looked like you...
(And I tremble alone to see
your hand in mine,
tremble lest you turn
into a woman one day!)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of last night I’ve touched you and I’ve felt you
unless my hand from my hand flew
unless my body flew, or what I knew:
in a manner almost new,
I’ve felt you.
Pulsing, not knowing
whether like blood or clouds I’m
fleeting
through the house on tiptoe, darkness coming
darkness cheating you ran through here shining.
You ran through my wooden house,
You opened its windows
And I felt you shake the entire night.
Daughter of the abyss silent in your
Spite so terrible so slight
That as much as everything might
Be for me it’s not without your light.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to hear a dream?...
Well, last night
I saw the fleeting breeze of the thicket
that when brushing against the clasp
of a lily that grew in the meadow
he recorded a "kiss" on her,
losing himself later swift and light
from the bower among the thick foliage.
This is my dream, all of it,
and if you understand it, you want, beautiful girl,
to join your lips in my lips,
and you will know who "he" is, and who "she" is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fierce of love, I suffer hunger for hearts.
Of pigeons, of vultures, of roe deer or lions,
There is no prey more tempting, there is no taste more pleasing;
I had already dulled my claws and my instinct,
When, erected, in an almost unreal plinth,
I was captivated by a statue of an ancient emperor.
And I grew in enthusiasm; along the stem of stone
My desire ascended like a fulmineous ivy
Up to his chest, nurtured seemingly in snow;
I shouted to the impossible heart… the sculpture
Most serene and pure, guarding its glory
With its brow in the future And its feet in the past.
Perennial was my desire, in the stem of stone
It has remained affixed like bloody ivy;
And ever since I gnaw in my dreams at the heart
Of a statue, exquisite prey for my beautiful claw;
It is neither flesh nor marble: the dough of a star
With no blood, with no warmth and with no heartbeat…
With the essence of a superhuman passion!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time has not given you the answers,
just new questions.
The light abates
over time, the streets become deserted,
from your room you only see
a future of tattered branches,
night crouched on the rooftops,
and you think you even feel that stillness
that precedes snow
like an inheld breath,
something that waits to be
and despairs at being.
Winter
makes everything simpler,
with its chisel of cold and wants.
It is a discipline,
an agreement between the world and its flip side,
the shadow side on which it rests.
The color of the evening
is the color of thought.
Upon the street there falls
a rinsed light, almost insulated,
and everything withdraws, drops away
as in a camera lens,
as if the world were a diagram of itself,
a sparse yet efficient map
that unearths the root of things.
The mind is pleased with winter.
Soothed by its edges,
its quiet economy,
the way it sticks to what it has.
It simplifies everything,
even these uneasy questions
that change over time,
that don't change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I open the door, and the scent of water
piercing the earth enters the room:
slow vapor that thickens the air and leaves
a seed of joy
on the skin:
the hours pass,
the rain doesn't let up,
the seed has grown a stalk
which tangles round my body;
outside it rains, but a sun rises up
before my eyes, which already forget
the rain's defeated gray:
tree that offers light, not shadow,
beneath its branches
I smile, without knowing why.
Blake wrote that death
was simply going from one room to another:
you leave, you go back in, the house
is the same, this space
open in the morning
by the scent of cut
grass, by this furtive
freshness that the air
brings to one's eyes,
just like that boy on the train
who held his breath
as if saying, look, look,
and then laughed,
I can stop time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We weren’t there when it happened.
We were on our way to another city,
another life,
under a changing sky that moved with us.
We crossed fields of green then yellow,
towns of suspicious people and impassive crows,
and not once did we miss our home
or feel nostalgia for the past.
That’s how the journey was:
at night silence,
in the morning mist.
Once I found a tin button in my pocket
and played at holding it under the sun,
throwing glimmerings onto the tall crops.
Later it was a used coin
and we had free passage at every checkpoint.
The plains of Europe are our witnesses.
They also know that something happened,
although we never saw it.
We were on our way to another country,
another life,
with neither flamboyant luggage
nor room for memories.
Everything opened before us,
now silence and later mist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given how things were,
he decided enough was enough,
the crackling of the sky sufficed,
the deep grey of the reedbeds.
“The gods kneel in your home,”
he heard, and smiled complacently.
Birds in the hand, the silence of sand
of the hours, the lime bridling the eyes.
The wafer of life melted on his tongue,
in his tentacular blood, and it was a serene,
almost expert tiredness,
the root of the snow sprouted in his hand.
Everything travelled on a tolerant track,
lights that shone or switched off depending on the time.
Retired to the peace of this desert,
what use are books, he refuted,
and then: and for whom.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inconstant flower.
I am the wood you crackle in,
the human stone inside its kidney,
the sedentary clutching at the seed,
your bridge traversed.
Discover me.
I am the one who turns to cast a shadow,
what strikes itself and splinters; smoke
that billows from the train of your pursuers;
a flock before the empty vase
right in the middle of the dazzled dining room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From this side of the jetty you can make out
each light from a building or a street lamp
as if they were boats.
Occasionally a freighter or a cruise ship leaves
the port with all of its lights glowing
and heads out across the sea.
And then you imagine those flickering
coastal lights also transforming into ships
and the houses and buildings begin to unmoor
and all of Santo Domingo sets sail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind is cold it burns
and causes those that wait for the quiet
crossing of the tram to shiver
The elderly lean
their heads against the glass
The boredom of life furrows their faces
They fog up the window with their lost
gaze their distant indifference
It’s Sarajevo the sun
lodges itself in holes left by mortar fire
the ruins the facades
There’s a transparency that wounds
the flight the course of birds
Faraway
the hills and lying in wait
they prey upon Sniper Alley
Nothing surprises me now or causes me to give up
not even should you say you’re leaving
that all you know how to do is leave
The waters of Miljacka
run suddenly old
they darken as they pass under the Princip bridge
With one perfect shot they killed
an Archduke here
We have died
in excess many lives together
On the threshold of an orthodox church
someone watches how
the light of the candles is used up
Extinct now the torches are taken away
The candlestick is empty
Welcome to hell reads
graffiti from another time
Of hell all that’s left
is this slow calm
that lingers even after it dwells in us
Cats root about in trash bags
Grass grows on the gravestones of garden cemeteries
The tram has passed
a racket a trembling
of the air behind the tracks
maybe a memory
nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taken in with you like a dream
I neither forget nor remember.
Sing the winter and I part from the others
words newly born:
those that we leave under the arc of pain
as we pass by trembling,
those that I wove into your wings
so your flight commands
the surrounding clay
the chaotic solitude which forsakes.
The night is a lamp and pours out
in a blast the oil of goodbyes.
In my pluvial dream the shadows cry out.
The relentless markers of the future
come and go like extras,
like tepid storms on a sea lacking salt
pyramids of weeping.
I neither remember nor forget.
I thread the convulsive needle
that rips me from your body
to gather you up the polished
superhumanness of the day.
Wait for us on your border
rain that is here in the rain
synthesis of water
see us as we are
see how we fall in this
a permanent prisoner of time
this is life.
You grow up in comfort, you believe so you can see the sun
it soon surprises you – a blast of air
and this emptiness
furnished with instruments of torture.
Your fine blood issues forth in a circle
to enter another –
an abyss intense and throbbing.
You advance while time backs away
and the beginning of innocence retires from the groove.
Bird of fire, free us
from your wild roots.
Your hands cling to a corner of the cloth
to a point of destiny.
The rain crosses the backwater of my dream,
drags along the current of other days and sings
bleaching the cesspool of the afternoon.
I sleep with a girl wrapped in air.
The rain sings into the heart of a seed
scratches up the earth and pulls up roots:  words
newly come.
Like in a cosmic dance
next comes the sun bearing miniature suns,
yours are sons of mine
together we play with these little ones
that will illuminate you,
Friend of the clouds
Daughter of the rain.
Daughter of the rain,
chain of beautiful looks, linger
under my eyes, search the fire
your visions as you call them
fill my dreams, a sun
of gilded roots
rides on your back,
my hand flows over your body
wants to fill you,
child who comes from what is full
to that which fails you.
Before you, came my mother to spread herself on my side
her body lit a flame in my blood
a bonfire of premonitions
my mother fashioned herself in me
I was her island
through me, arrived a latent sea
but my feet burned.
I was filled with my mother,
duplicating her stride
dragging myself like a shadow
by her shores.
She extended her gaze over me
and in a vision of ardent fire
you reclined as well, reunited
sap of our glances.
I burned over the face of my mother
dreaming myself a girl who wove souls,
outlining paths over the water
to arrive at you, root hastened,
simultaneous deep journey
in my unoccupied body.
Now my mother empties herself newly in me
I am her forge
I embrace slow wards that unite
in a dream that burns.
I sleep with a girl wrapped in air.
This
is not a poem.  You move in a dream
of tossed waters,
the lamp tumbles anew
and the fire runs over,
your eyes so able to look inside me
ignite distant bonfires.
The fire defines contours of water
drops disperse in collections
of columns that open like arms
in an ornamental sky, empty.
I search for hexagonal words,
a prism that opens across the page, faults
those who write stark measures.
Your hands lazy over my chest
open and close my books.
The guard of our dream is a sleepy one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red centaur of the golden horns grows, 
Bloody clouds burn the copper massif. 
The sea smothers the interminable dream, it wounds the flood 
With wicked splendors. 
The sunset already asserts itself, like a miracle, and weakens 
The solitude of postcards. 
The savage wing among the branches 
Stops its flight with wild violets, 
Then the distant pupil of the eye attempts its return. 
Incessant in the secret words that time 
Will engrave on the stone or on the snow, 
The sunset is a god of gold in a dark world, 
I open my eyes and the desert roars 
From its magnificent sands. 
I am not the sunset, but its splendor is in me. 
On the gray grass gigantic towers rise, 
The sea lights up its stained-glass windows. 
On the burning walls the color of my eyes ascends, 
The horizon trembles on the yellow marble like the locks 
Of a woman, 
It mists up with splendor the mirrors and the sturdy 
Trees with their ancient songs in their branches. 
Who can be more happy at this time when the sky sleeps 
And dreams about magicians and tales of miracles? 
From the ashes of the afternoon tigers are reborn 
That die when night comes, their eyes fixed on the sea. 
Look at the landscape where one day you’ll die, 
Under this glare of a hundred swords you will find 
The last face, 
The terrible colors, the infinite beauty of the dreams 
Of those who do not dream, dispersed on the beaches, 
And you will see my lit-up face 
And you will love my music, 
And you will put this flower of fire on your breast. 
Mortal lips will say your name with brilliance 
In the words, William Turner.
