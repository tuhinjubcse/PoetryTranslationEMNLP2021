Do not exit the room, do not mend the wrong.
Why does the sun, if you smoke Pinkka?
The world behind the door is amusing, especially the sigh of happiness.
Only in the dresser's place — and return at once.
O, do not exit the room, don’t вызываn the motor.
Because the corridor is bound with halls,
and ends with a number. But if the living one enters
my doll, unfolding its branches, breaking not its edges.
Do not go out of the room; it’s snug for you.
What more fascinating than a pall and a wall?
Why to go from there, from where you’ll return in the evening,
the same, what you were, and why were you so betrayed?
Oh, don’t leave the room. I’m speaking in a Russian
in a coat to the naked body, wearing sandals on the barefoot leg.
The passersby smell the scent of snow in the bygone days.
You’ve written so many letters, that one will be extravagant.
Don’t leave the room. O, if it’s only a room
It’s to guess how you look. And you are anonymous.
aergo, like the shape that she has noticed in my heart, a substation.
Don’t go out of the room! A tea, not France.
Don’t be a fool! Be what no one was not.
Don’t go out of the room! That is, let the furniture be,
lie face to face with the wallpaper. Hover, let loose.
the blackened rack from the solar array, space, and chrome,

The October day has come, the woods are full of burning
The last leaves off its naked branches.
The autumn ice is blanketed and the road is frozen.
The humming bird is flying past the mill-house still.
But the pool’s cooled already; my neighbor rushes
Into the fields left behind by his hunting,
And watch the lake with ferocious idleness,
Wakes up the dogs sleeping in the woods by the morning sleigh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now it's my time: I don't like the spring;
I am bored with the thaw, vileness, spring...
Blood roams about; thoughts are hid in thirst.
I am more satisfied in the winter now,
I love her snow; in the presence of the moon
Like the light run of sanes with their lady friend’s speed,
When under the autumn tree, warm and fresh,
She clutches your hand, glittering, shivering!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How cheerful, with legs imbued with iron sharp!
To glide through the mirrors of the standing rivers, the dead!
And sparkling holidays' troubles?..
But you must know honour, six months of snow and frost,
For this is a good thing for the bear-bearer,
To the bear, they’ll need it. It’s impossible
To ride in the sledges with the girls of the Army
Or sour in the two-glassed feather-grass.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, red summer! I would love you,
If it were not for heat, then dust, moss and flame,
You, destroying all human being's ability,
You torture us like the fields do, we suffer from wretchedness;
To make wine, to light up oneself —
We all have no other thought, and I pity the winter's old women,
And, having followed her with cries and wine,
We give mercy to her with pure and ice-floe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last days of the autumn, unlikely, abuse
But I admire her, my dear reader,
Like quiet beauty, that shines meekly and quietly.
So unloved child in the dear land
To me. And I must tell you insinuated,
I'm glad only of one season from year to year,
There is much good in it; a good lover, not renowned,
I found it, beautiful, by my own way.
...................................--------------------------------
How can this explain? I like it,
How, likely, you will like the consumptive maiden
Sometimes I like it. Côte de Death, I was doomed,
Poor thing stoops without rage or complaining,
On the dry lips the smile is seen,
She does not hear the yoke of the grave-mound;
And a still-crimson flower plays on my face.
She is still alive today, tomorrow no more,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Desolate пора! of one's eyes' enchantment!
Your departing beauty appeals to me rather,
I love nature's exalted branches,
In crimson and in gold dressed forests,
Their nets have a whisper and a fresh breath;
And through the wavy mist are covered the skies,
The rare sun beam, and the first frosts,
And the far-off grey winter threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With each autumn bloom, I am blossoming once more;
I find the Russian cold is beneficial to my health;
Again I feel love for my everyday life:
In sequence, sleep, and hunger are found;
Blood plays joyfully in my heart,
Desires seethe, — I'm happy and young again,
I am again full of life, that is how my body is found,
(Forgive me the useless prose of wit).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horses are leading me; in the open space,
With his mane the horseman drags.
And ringingly under his shining hooves
The frozen ice has трескаd and cracked.
But in the forgotten camp the light goes out.
The fire again flames; then blazes the bright light,
Now it fades slowly — and I am reading before him
Or forging long thoughts in my soul.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I forget the world — and in sweet silence
I fall asleep sweetly with my imagination,
And poetry then awakes in me:
The soul is disenchanted with a poetical wave,
Trembles and sounds, and looks as in a dream,
To sink, finally, in the freedom of expression,
And right here comes an invisible crowd,
The fruit of my dream, the trees of the old days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And in my head the thoughts roar with elation,
And whispering verses rise to meet them,
And my fingers aspire to the pen, and the page to paper,
A minute and the poems will flow freely.
Thus a ship drowns in a motionless laze,
But hark! — the sailors burst forth, they crawl along
Up, down — and the sails are filled with steam;
The thunder swirled and scatters the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patiently, as one splits gravel,
Patiently, as one awaits death
Patiently, as news mature,
Patiently, as one cherishes revenge –
I will wait for you (with fingers clenched -
As a monarch waits for the hostage)
Patiently, as one awaits rhymes
Patiently, as one bites one's hands.
I will wait for you (looking at the ground —
Teeth to lips. Locked. Stone).
Patiently, as one prolongs bliss,
Patiently, as one strings beads.
The squeaking of runners, creaking
Doors: the roar of the Taiga winds.
An imperial decree arrived: —
- The Tsar has changed, and the Lord is coming.
And let me go home:
In the earthly -
It's yet mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters — heaviness and tenderness — are the same.
Медуницы and wasps are sucking the heavy rose.
Man dies. The heated sand is chilling,
And yesterday's sun is carried away on a black stretcher.
Ah, heavy honeycombs and tender nets,
It is easier to lift a stone than to repeat your name!
I have a single care left in this world,
A golden care — to overcome the burden of time.
I drink the dark air like dark water
Time is ploughed, and a rose was the soil.
In the slow whirlpool the heavy and tender roses,
The roses’ heaviness and tenderness are entwined into twin wreaths.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only the snakes squeeze their rough faces
That my soul grows wise and full.
Alas, we are not like snakes,
We change not body, but souls.
Memory, you who are the greatest
Life you lead, like horse’s undertaker,
You will tell me about those I knew
In this body lived till I died.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first one: he's unshady and thin,
Having loved only the gloomy grove,
A poplar leaf, a child of magic powers,
The rain that stopped by the name.
A tree, a red-haired dog —
With those he took with him in his friends.
Memory, you will not find a sign,
The world would not believe that I was there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second... He loved the south wind,
In every hum I've heard the lires ring,
He said life was his dear friend,
Under his feet — the world.
It doesn’t appeal to me at all, this
He wanted to be a god and a tsar
He commanded the sign of a poet
Over the doors into my silent home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the choicest of freedom,
With a arrow and a furnace of fire,
Ah, the waters sounded so loudly
And the clouds envyed him.
His tent was tall and overgrown,
The smiles were sharp and austere,
He drunk on sweet air like wine,
White is the gift of an unknown land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, you are weaker year by year,
Is that the one or the other
I exchanged for the merry freedom
In the sacred, long-awaited battle.
He knew the tortures of hunger and thirst,
Sleep, unending, uninterrupted,
But holy George has touched us twofold
Not touched by poison, my breast lies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I, — a weary and stubborn boatman
Of a temple rising in gloom,
I praised my Father’s glory,
In heavens and on earth as well.
Heart will be with flames of a flame forever
until the days when the truths will be clear
The walls of the New Jerusalem
On the meadows of my native land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the strange wind is howling —
And the awful light will pour from the sky
This Milky Way blossomed unwelcomely
The garden of blinding planets.
Before me will come, unknown,
A stranger hides his face; I understand
Seeing an lion with the goal of leaving
And an eagle that flew toward him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cry... but who can help,
That my soul should not die?
Only the snakes squeeze their rough faces
We change not body, but souls.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That the body for earth is
how not повод to hide
and hide beneath the cover
Of leaves, snow, oblivion –
Not to be.
A bird is crying at the dawn
About every one who lay a white shirt,
about beauty and valor.
And sobbing and dancing at the dawn.
Why did you turn, my heart, upon your knees?
And ask for mercy as if by chance.
They will burn you down and scatter your dust —
No one will recall.
And my heart then says to me:
“There remained a fire on your shoulder
on my shoulders as before.”
A heart stranger, a melting sun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I write letters. Letters to you. The thing that was said in the midnight.
Years pass by.
The ribbon’s needles are bitten.
And nobody will be brought back.
You can cry so much you want.
Shake the lamp.
You’ll be pressed to a certain tree by the forehead
and to wait.
The sky and the air are so many!
Nothing to breathe.
The rain has wrapped it all in wind,
Their feet were fastened to the floor,
Bare feet, with slender streams of blood.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We enter the night. We are a pair of axe-blades
aloft on ghostly horses.
Glaze in places and on the ground,
but just weep and glow.
To shed the horses and see the scars,
and squeeze from the empty sea.
Beyond, there are just glimpses of failure.
Sail, but where? — Around with poison.
And everywhere our dead are —
in the trees, the holidays, and the flowers.
Death will not let me awake
The same ashes lies on their lips.
The light is blazing, stand: how hard it is,
when night goes out of our eyes.
Instead of heart the coal rings out,
and scatters away into the night.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps this is the fear of leaves in autumn days?
David is feeling the openness with his empty eyes;
Forgotten he had become a stone long ago, and now he has nowhere to run.
The steppe-like ripples of potatoes in the width of the distance.
Tomorrow the snow will fall. It will change our faces, knitted with old knots of wrinkles.
The white goats of winter hit the garden, eating apples from the pond,
and they’ll glance through the windows, where we warm our hands above the gentle fire.
Such are the days, like drops in a lonely cell, locked up.
We trembled like David to penetrated this earth with our two legs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The voice wailing over blind windows, the trembling voice,
into these walls, as if naked boulevards were gathered.
The voice from the throat, as if from nowhere blue,
I stumbled upon the stumbling, the hissing clusters.
between them, among, the coarse snows of the station,
like blade of grass, having caught the sword in its clasp.
Stillness there! Either the cheeks are burning, or the heart
the drops of rain fall down from the sky and roll down in cascade.
Voice! It's not gnawed at the spinning wheels, not overturned,
nerves, flying under the scarlet rock of the vaults.
Following only the glances of the muteness, today, tomorrow,
remaining in the blue twilight of their coming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The action is continuing by the waters,
War is not for soldiers, campfires, swords and кирas,
The Jews the left shore of war do not tend,
The pearls are standing on the wall,
This battle never will end, it will take us down
Through blizzard and flood, the whole span of time,
It will hold its own like a radiant winter,
For the cavalry is attacking them from the sky.
Darkness descends from underground,
And heels first hurt then unsettled.
Each of us stands on this or that stage.
Every one of us has not momentarily set up his gun.
Each of us, while the others are still alive,
Looks where the chorus of strangers is confounding,
The rattling and the routing are rushing
Where you are forced to make a poet.
Take me into Jews or Peruvians,
I dream of this from the third class:
To step for you like a deer or a bull,
Like a victim’s boulder, or a fat notebook,
Like a girl явленной in the bushes!
With a sword in my chest I sing without dying
In the war that leads to Paradise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the board is beginning, everything is rustling,
They take from them new witnesses — and they bring
The second-hand brings the verdict on,
Turns into a condemned man.
Conspiration is brought to the fore,
The doctors and the head of the prison are usually there.
No one is let in here by kin.
journalists are also banned here.
That’s where the doomed and the tortured are launched,
Their shoulders, their wrists and their halo,
They’re telling me to have a smoke taste,
They give a stab, give the change of current,
The accursed man turns into a bear.
They are usually not called by their kin,
Though there is one exception to every rule:
A dacha there is with guards — from the lakes to the woods.
Unwashed wild herons gather in the zoo and square,
To curcumbic collectives, to private corners:
They are discreet, but well are taught,
They sometimes stand behind, and mothers sometimes say «hi»
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Красy, mute, — that is in Russian hardly a word,
I like her surroundings, her bread and her scarf,
All and everyone's dressing gown exhausts the praise.
When she sips at the corner and shows off her goods.
Her fingers take it for the shivering beetles, her neck – the burden
Of green-haired, sand-worn, mangy-breasted, and sweet стоchasing,
The dark flesh of the bacchanalian it spins and sinks into white.
The flesh of a crackling record; and there's a fraction.
And the hump is like a mother, and she doesn’t look at
And shamefaces its public profession.
I am asking her a question, and she never gives an answer.
I go to her as a thief, and she can’t hold the braggart.
It is lazily labored, and by the cheap labourer's power
All gathered in one and couldn’t bear a conversation.
Her common father will descend on the blue hills
Scarcely innocent, at the first light.
Her father, common to her, is eloquent:
The doctor, the owner of the cloudless hospital,
Where somebody’s ribcage is pressing open,
And fear unfurls its opulent eyelashes.
Her and common father, he follows her daughter in his stead,
Stretches on a dark road day and night,
Like a streak of fog on the walls of a car.
When his soldiers rush to the city
And will become the fountain in the Red Square
And the hungry make their way on the path,
Holding her jump-coats by the samovar-holy,
We'll wait for them at the bottom of the grim pit,
Where she was scolded by her boss today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The doctors still allow us to smoke in the station,
They understand: this is work, they have to smoke,
They follow one in their course: Hey, commander,
The second from the table lifts his eyes to the door;
The second from the court raises its eyes to the cripple,
There is a lamp where to where, Светлана, is what I shall say,
When the earth shakes, and the soil opens its mouth,
And the arrested ones locked up in a wall?
The third rises, with заслугs, and all is brought to him,
But they called him and he is coming.
“Жet me at dawn,” he says to his comrades,
That he and they are him and another’s contribution,
One like Isaac is waiting for him like tempests.
What is the blue sign on his finger, sister?
A strong sign on his hand, his dearest friend.
There it is written like so: loved one,
My beloved, you have saved your self, take not with all,
Call your parents, in the trees take a break,
If you can’t get one, find another one
And if you’re hurt, call me and ask me forgiveness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not wait for me home, my darling,
No friend, no foe.
I condemn the plight:
A single war reigns in the field.
We board the boardwalk
At the bottom of the earth,
Blizzards strike with their fiery wings
But we have left them.
Those who were here not long ago,
And those who aren’t long ago
Lie in the darkness, like houses,
And they listen to their cinema
And earth between us is flowing
As strong as wine,
We used to be people. Now we are
White noise,
A scent of tears and seeds,
The roots and the mountains.
I am but a tusk of strings,
Spreading across the land,
And the one who stood with you by the window,
consists of deep pits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then the final song’s sung,
Бойцы of an invisible front:
They go out of their surroundings,
Somewhere between two and three lines run from the shoulders,
Approach the meeting place,
And peered at her with unceasing eyes.
They’re fated to die,
Already cannot be washed away with water!
How they donned me,
Can't say Russianly.
But with their old, expert hands
They offer them their rifles,
With sighted fingers the light can’t reach.
They look for «campers» and «priests»
They try to bring from the wounds a comfort
Letters, so deeply засевшие –
And towards dusk, without clearing a bound,
Into the city that sleepless is found.
And silently wait till the cannon bursts.
And silently while the muse's humming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rain in the grimacing room. Sundown. Среда.
Having closed the hood, I lift up my collar.
For four days they bombed the city,
and there’s no city left. In a state
not people who hide in the vestibule
while the tide is blowing. Nearby alleys
they don’t go mad at all in these circumstances,
and, falling, do not seek vengeance.
June’s noon. A wreath of silk pours
on the smokestack. A choir of children’s voices.
Around – the crumbling new constructions.
The Corbyge has something akin to the Lute
that we two had labored from the heart
over the shape of Europe in the future.
What will be forgotten in the cycles,
the end of their long drawn-out pencils.
Neither to cure, nor to cause ills,
Having failed to distinguish the goal from the means,
he’s picking at strawberries. The stronger, from a raspberry.
Night. A century too late,
we drink wine while the summer stars are shining
in the room on the 20th floor
the level that has been achieved already
in flames — those who once soar up into the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The northern wind is how it will rise
blue, lilac, smoky, and scarlet
of the nature’s redemption. And he
not see the slender change of tide,
the hens are curling in the yard,
farmyard by the road.
Upon the air’s flow, распlauding, alone,
And all that he sees is in the future
of hills and rivers,
like a living blade of throne,
steel in the pre-cast reedbines,
схожие to the beads towns
New England. Numbers fallen to zero
themeters look like flattened lams;
cold, pacing up the alarms,
Of leaves, spurs of churches, But for
A falcon, not a church. Above us,
of worldly aspirations,
he splashes in the blue sea, he’s clutching his beak,
with plush being pressed to your stomach,
- Together two to the fist, just like two hands
hi hi, each feather pervades the
down, letting in answer an eyelid
with berries, and to the South
to Rio-Gran, to the dive, the open,
nooses, that in powerful foam are hiding
grass with sharp blades aglow
a nest, a broken shroud,
the алую blade, smell, shadows,
sister, brother, sister.
A heart with flesh, pearl, and wing,
that beats steadily, that trembles,
exactly like a knife-judge
my own motorized by the warmth,
the autumn blue, that is her also.
the sum of all this
the stain of an eye that's barely seen,
the point that falls beneath the tree
for that, empty in his face, they
the child in the blizzard sitting by the window,
the pair who stepped out of the car
the wings of a woman.
But a steaming torrent of waters elevates
higher, higher. In the feathers’ plumage
wears a cold. Seeing below,
he sees the horizon’s fading,
he sees as if the thirteen first
of states, he can see: from
Smoke plumes up from the chimneys. But how once
to tell us that in the dark, lonely
To the bird, as it’s risen.
Oh, where have I come from!
He hears the sound of a trivial song
pride. When he turns his head round,
Its wings fall down, But the elongated
Its air returns to the sky,
into the colorless icy smoothness.
In the yellow pupil comes evil vision,
of light. That is, a match of anger
with horror. He again
plunges down. But like a wall, it is a ball,
Like the fall of a sinful man, he will enter again in faith,
and pulls it back, driving it along.
It, which is still hot!
In that devil-face. Into the eastern skies.
In an awful heavenlyscopernal hell
a bird where there’s no oxygen,
Where, instead of washing, came the wave of distant
for two-legged heights of stars,
for the ragged, contrarywise.
Not as a splinter, but in your light
he can’t escape, of course.
Then he screams. Out of the bent, cackling,
the sword, похожий on the whistling of an ery
scrapes and flies into the distance
the inexpressible sound of wheels,
the sound of lute, who’s plunged into aлюmiний;
of consciousness, that is
designed for no one’s ears:
Of humanity, that from the birch leaves
white-nosed linden, or flowers’ bounty,
small field-mouse we’re to use;
so the tears cannot be thrown over
no one else. Just dogs
assault their faces. A piercing, tearful cry
the more dreadful, more terrible than re-died
the diamond that cuts the glass,
the moon crosses the sky. And the world
as if it’s been choked so hard.
Because in the sky there, below,
like fire in space, down below,
And the red arm of the fence is lit
without gloves. We, castigating him,
There!” we see above us the tear
the hawk, plus the spider, the sound
the agitation of shallows,
running to the vaulted sky
No echo where the smell of apotheosis
the sound, especially in October.
And inside the circle of this star, alike,
scurried, fettered by frost,
on a silvery goblet
A bird is floating on the rack,
into the purple. In our watch we can see
the shining detail, the finger.
We hear: something is ringing in the sky,
like dishes that are glazed and broken,
like ancestral crystal,
whose arrows won’t hurt me, but I know
in their palms. For a moment,
Again you can see the shapes, the eyes,
the fan, a rainbow streak,
incoherence, squares, a link,
my bells, my hair —
The former arch of the pen,
the map with the signature of
flies on the slope of the hill.
They were caught by the fingers of a child.
run out to the street in a colorful jacket
and yells out in a high-pitched voice
