Do not leave the room, do not make a mistake.
Why do you want the sun if you smoke Shipka?
Everything is meaningless behind the door, especially the cry of happiness.
Only in the bathroom - and immediately return.
Oh, don't go out of the room, do not call the engine.
Because the space is made of a corridor
and it ends with a counter.
the ball, the mouth eating, driving out without undressing.
Don't go out of the room; think you've lost your mind.
What is more interesting in the light of the wall and the chair?
Why go out from where you will return in the evening
as thou wast, and moreover, as a reprobate?
Oh, don't leave the room. Dance, catch, bossa nova
in a coat for the naked body, in shoes on the bare foot.
In the hallway smells of cabbage and ski ointment.
Thou hast written many letters; yet another will be too many.
Do not go out of the room. Oh, let only room
And in general, incognito
ergo sum as observed form in the heart substance.
Do not leave the room! On the street, tea, not France.
Do not be a fool! Be what others were not.
Do not leave the room! That is, let the furniture,
paint your face with wallpaper.

October has already come — already the forest ripples
The last leaves of the nakedness of their branches;
The autumn frost is blowing and the road is freezing.
The rooster is still running behind the mill of the stream,
But the pond is already frozen; my neighbor is hurrying
And he went out into the fields with his hunting;
And the lakes shall be filled with the joy of astonishment;
And the dogs wake up sleeping oak trees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now is my time: I do not like spring;
I am tempted by the ash; the wind, the dirt, in the spring am I sick;
Blood wanders; feelings, the mind is dullly constrained.
I am more satisfied with the harsh winter,
I love her snow; in the presence of the moon
As the swift running of a sleigh with a friend is speedy and leisurely,
When it is warm and fresh under the bush,
She shakes your hand, burning and trembling!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As fun, shoe iron sharp legs,
Slide through the mirror of standing, even rivers!
And winter holidays brilliant alarms?..
But it is necessary to know and honor; six months snow yes snow,
For it is at last to the inhabitant of Berlin,
The bear is bored. It is impossible for a whole century
Ride with us in our sleds with the younger Armidas
Il acidify in the furnaces behind double glazing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, summer is red! I would love you,
When there is no heat, no dust, mosquitoes, flies.
You, losing all your spiritual abilities,
Thou afflictest us; we are as the fields, we suffer the drought;
Only as if to drink, to refresh oneself —
There is no other thought in us, neither is there any pity in the winter of the old woman;
And he led her away with bread and wine;
We make her memories with ice cream and iced tea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The days of the latter autumn are a feast of feasting,
But to me she is sweet, dear reader,
The beauty of quiet, shining humbly.
Such an unloved child in the family of the native
I am drawn to myself. I will tell you frankly,
From time to time I am glad only to her alone,
There is much good in her; the lover is not in vain;
I found something in it a dream of my own.
----------------------------------------------------------
How to explain it? I like it,
How Probably You Have A Floating Girlfriend
Poroua likes. Sentenced to death,
The poor woman bows without murmur, without anger.
A smile is visible on the lips of those who have fallen asleep;
She heareth not the cry of the grave;
It has a purple color on its face.
She is still alive today, not tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sad time! Eyes charming!
I like your farewell beauty —
I love the splendor of nature's devotion,
And the forests clothed in scarlet and gold,
In their shadows the wind is noise, and the breath is fresh;
And the heavens are covered with a whirlwind;
And the rare ray of the sun, and the first frosts,
And the remote threats of the gray winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And with every autumn I bloom again;
Russian cold is useful to my health;
I feel love for the habits of being again:
A dream falls by chance, and a hunger strikes;
Easily and joyfully plays the blood in the heart,
Wishes boil - I'm happy again, young,
I am full of life again - this is my body
(Allow me to forgive unnecessary prose.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They bring a horse to me in the open valley;
When he has gathered the horn, he carries the rider;
And the bell under his shining hoof
The snow melts and the ice breaks.
But a short day passes away, and in a forgotten chamber
The fire burns again, and the bright light pours out;
It melts slowly - and I read in front of it
I nourish the long dust in my soul.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I forget the world - and in sweet silence
I am sweetly asleep in my imagination,
And poetry is awakened in me:
The soul is shy with lyrical excitement,
He trembleth and heareth, and seeketh, as in a dream;
To be poured out at last by free manifestation —
And there comes to me an invisible roar of guests,
Friends are old, the fruits of my dream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the thoughts of the head are stirred up in courage,
And the light rhymes run to meet them;
And the fingers shall ask for a pen, and the pen for paper;
A minute, and the verses will flow freely.
So sleeps the immovable ship in the stillness,
But what! — the sailors suddenly throw, slip
Up and down, and the sails are inflated, the wind is full;
The crowd moved and cut the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gently, as the gravel beats,
As they wait patiently for death,
How patiently they see the news,
Patiently, as revenge heals -
I'll wait for you (fingers crossed -
So the monarchy waits for the concubine)
As the rhymes wait patiently,
It is painful, as the hands are folded.
I will wait for you (in the earth - a look,
Teeth in lips.
As patiently as I am,
Patiently, as a bead nizhut.
Violin of half-breeds, reverse violin
Doors: a rotor of melting winds.
The highest came rescript:
- The change of the kingdom and the entrance of a noble.
And home:
In the non-terrestrial -
Yes, it is mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters - gravity and tenderness - your signs are the same.
Copper coins and ashes sow a heavy rose.
Man dies. The sand is heated,
And yesterday's sun on black stretchers carry.
Ah, heavy straws and delicate nets,
It is easier to lift up a stone than to repeat your name.
I have one care in the world:
The golden care as time burden to be left.
Like dark water, I drink muffled air.
The time was ploughed, and the rose was ground.
In a slow whirlwind heavy gentle roses,
Roses weight and tenderness in double wreaths woven!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only the serpents cast off the skins,
So that the soul may grow old and grow.
We, alas, are not like serpents;
We change souls, not bodies.
Memory, you are the hand of the giant
You lead your life like a horse's hindquarters,
You'll tell me about those who used to
In this body lived before me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first: ugly and thin,
Who loved only the gloom of the groves,
A leaf that is decayed, a child of sorcery,
In a word, the rain stopped.
Tree da red dog -
This is the man whom he took to be his friend;
Memory, memory, you don't have a sign,
You will not believe the world that it was I.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second... he loved the wind from the south,
In every noise I heard the sound of lyres,
He said that life is his friend,
The cradle under his feet is peace.
It doesn't like me at all, it's
He wanted to be a god and a king;
He hung a poster of the poet
Over the doors to my silent house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the chosen one of freedom,
The sailor and the gunner,
Ah, the waters sang so loudly to him
And they envied the clouds.
His tent was high;
And the seagulls were sharp and strong;
Like wine, he drank the sweet air
White of an Unknown Country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, you are weaker year by year,
Whether it's him or anyone else
Changed the Joyful Freedom
On the sacred long-awaited battle.
He knew the agony of hunger and thirst;
The sleep is troubled, the way is endless,
But St. George touched twice
My breasts are not touched.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a sullen and stubborn architect
A temple rising up in the twinkling of an eye,
I have striven for the glory of the Father;
As in heaven and on earth.
The heart will be a flame palimo
Until the day when they shall rise and be made manifest;
Walls of New Jerusalem
On the fields of my native country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then a strange wind blows,
And there shall be a terrible light from heaven;
This Milky Way blossomed unexpectedly
A garden of dazzling planets.
He will appear before me, I do not know;
The wayfarer hideth his face, but I know all things;
Seeing the lion after him,
and the eagle flying to him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll scream... but who will help,
That my soul may not die?
Only the serpents cast off the skins,
We change souls, not bodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a body for the earth!
as no reason to hide
and hide under cover
leaves, snow, oblivion –
Not to be.
Every bird cries at dawn
about every one who lies on a white bone,
about beauty, and about vanity.
And weeping, and dancing at dawn.
Why are you on your knees, heart?
And you ask for mercy as if.
They shall burn thee, and scatter the dust;
No one will remember.
And my heart answered me,
"The fire from your shoulder remained
on my shoulder."
A small heart, the sun shining.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I write letters. To you. About which talked at midnight.
Years go by.
The nerves are threaded into a needle.
And no one will be returned.
You can shout as much as you want.
Smile at the lamp.
You can cling to a tree with your back
and wait.
There is so much sky and air!
Nothing to breathe.
Internal rain has soaked everything –
and his feet clung to the ground;
naked legs, with thin streams of veins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are at night. We shave from the ashes
riding on ghostly horses.
Angry nowhere, no place,
but weeping and burning.
and to look upon the horses, and see the scars;
and to draw from the empty bottom.
There are some losses behind us.
To wash, but where? - around the brick.
And our dead everywhere -
in trees, in feasts, and in flowers.
From death does not allow to wake up
and the same ashes were on their mouths.
But when the light shines, stand still, how hard it is!
when the night is gone out of his sight.
And instead of the heart the coal is extinguished;
and it shall be scattered abroad at once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps it is the fear of leaves in the autumn day?
With empty eyelids David the victor feels space;
He forgot that he had long been turned into a stone, and there was no way for him to flee.
The raw horizon is like a cut of potatoes under the blow of a shovel.
Tomorrow it will snow. It will change our faces, sewing through the harsh threads of wrinkles.
And the white goats shall pass through our garden in winter, eating the bark of the apple tree;
and they shall look into the windows, where we have warmed our hands over the quiet fire of the geraniums.
These days are like drops in a solitary confinement.
And we are as David, and we have grown up in this land with two feet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A voice striking at blind windows, a voice trembling,
and the walls were like nails, as though they had not been pierced by chance.
The voice of the throat is like a dove out of a bride's womb;
and they stumbled upon the deaf, and on the fingers of the thunderbolts that whispered in the midst of them.
Between them, between, in the snow-capped air,
And he said to them, Behold, he is as a cloth, as the flesh that hath known the scalpel.
What a silence! Is it hot on the cheek, or just
the droplets from the sky are melting and falling down on it like drops.
The voice is not caught, the wheels are not bruised, nor driven,
nervous, flying under the raw stone of the vaults.
Afterwards – only the gazes of the parishioners, today, tomorrow,
who are left in the blue twilight of their coming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The action continues at the water,
War is not for life, trenches, swords, barracks,
The Jews occupy the left bank of the war,
On the right wall there are pyramids.
This battle is on foot, never ending,
And he shall rebuke and chastise five hundred generations;
It stands on its own, like a nuclear winter,
For from heaven they are attacked by a cavalry;
And darkness cometh from under the earth;
Tightening the heel and splitting the knees.
Each of us stands on this or that.
Each of us did not immediately lay down weapons.
Every one of us, as long as we are alive,
He sees where the counsellors are,
The riders are screaming and shouting,
Where you become a poet involuntarily.
Take me to a meal or a drink;
I have been dreaming about it since the third grade:
To be for you a deer or a sheep;
a sacrificial calf, or a fat one,
A virgin revealed in the bushes!
With a sword in my breast I sing and do not die
In a war on the way to paradise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The meeting begins, everything is buzzing,
Witnesses are brought out and new ones are introduced,
The second and the fifth shall be condemned;
The accused becomes a convicted person.
The sentence shall be carried out,
Usually the doctor and the head of the prison.
Relatives are not allowed here.
Journalists are not allowed here either.
The condemned shall be launched there, one by one;
Fix shoulders, ankles and wrists,
Give a smoke in the last,
Give a shot, give alternating current,
The condemned becomes a bear.
Their relatives do not usually take them away;
Although I know one exceptional case:
They keep on the cottage, with security, there is a forest to the edges.
The unwanted are dispersed in zoos,
For circus groups, private living spaces:
Non-aggressive, well-trained,
They walk on the back, "mom" sometimes speak.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful, silent, that is, in Russian barely two,
I like its surroundings, spices, sugar and all the chalva,
All the challah of all things giveth praise;
When she is in the corner and hangs up the goods.
Her fingers are taken by the sides of the dead, her neck is a burden
Green, crushed, sweet-smelling pears,
She plunges the dark flesh of the bridegroom into the white
The flesh of the crunchy plastic; and the price is born.
And Hurma is like a mother to her, and she doesn't look at her
And he is ashamed of his public profession.
I ask her a question and she doesn't answer.
I go in like a thief, and she will not hold the thieves.
Weakening it, its cheap labor force
The whole gathered in hands and will not carry out a conversation.
Her and her common father shall come down like an avalanche;
She is hardly innocent.
She and her common father, the senior manager,
The chief physician of the mountain empty hospital,
Someone's ribs are stretched out like lies
And fear breeds flattened eyelashes.
She and her common father, he will go to his daughter, and she will be his wife.
On the dark road stretches day and night,
Like a strip of fog at the walls of the carriage.
When his armies shall pass through the city,
And they shall be a bone in the throat by the Red Square.
And they that are hasty shall walk in the ways, quenching the famine;
Taking puppies at the roller coaster,
We will wait for them at the bottom of the mound;
Where the manager of Julia today scolded her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the department we are still allowed to smoke,
Understand: work such, it is necessary to smoke,
One on the way catch up: hey, commander,
The second from the table lifts up his eyes to the door;
The second from the court raises his eyes to the hook;
There is a lamp here and there, Svetlana, what I will say,
When the earth is shaken, and the soil opens its mouth,
And the arrested will stumble into the wall?
The third riseeth, he hath merit, and all are with him;
But they called, and he went.
"Wait for me at dawn," he says to his companions,
If it be he and they, it is he, and someone else;
Who is like Job, who waits for him like a storm?
What is the blue mark on his hand, sister?
It is a strong sign on his hand, friend.
It says something like this: beloved,
My beloved, take heed to yourselves, and do not take hold of all;
Call your parents, take a leave on Wednesday,
You will not take – try to behave well
Call me if you need me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't wait for us home, dear,
No friend, no me.
I report the situation:
Around one war.
We are based in the earthquake
At the bottom of the earth,
Above us are the flaming torches,
But we left them.
And those who are here recently,
And those who for a long time,
They lie in darkness like houses,
And listen to their movies
And between us the earth flows
It is as good as wine.
We were people. Now we are
White ear,
We smell of tears and sperm,
And the roots, and the stubble.
And I myself am only a cloth-cloth,
He who is enamoured in the uttermost parts,
And he that stood by the window with thee,
It consists of deep pits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last songs are collected,
Fighters of the Invisible Front:
Out of the surroundings,
Two or three lines flee from captivity,
Go to the meeting place,
Watching with interest.
As they darkened,
Do not rinse with water anymore!
As they were clothed,
They can't speak Russian.
But with old, skillful hands
They give ammunition,
To the light with your eyesighted fingers
They pick up the “calashnikovs,”
And they shall draw him out of the wound, when he is cold;
Deep-seated letters –
And it came to pass in the morning, when he had passed over the threshold,
They enter a sleepless city.
And they are silent while the cannons roar.
And they are silent while the music is playing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rain in Rotterdam. Twilight. Wednesday.
When I open the umbrella, I lift up the gate.
They bombed the city for four days,
and the cities ceased.
There are no people hiding in the entrance
during the rain. Streets, houses
do not go crazy in these cases
and when they fall, they do not seek vengeance.
July afternoon. dripping from the waffle
A chorus of children's voices.
Around – huge new buildings.
The Corbusier has something in common with the Luftwaffe,
that both of them had labored from their hearts
on changing the face of Europe.
What the cyclops will forget in their fury,
Then the pencils will finish.
As time neither healing, but cult,
without seeing the means of discernment from the end,
and the stronger it is from the panacea.
Night. Three decades later,
we drink wine under the big summer stars
in the apartment on the twentieth floor --
at the level already achieved
who once flew here in the air.
