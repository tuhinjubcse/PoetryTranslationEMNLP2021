Don’t leave your room, don’t commit that fateful mistake.
Why risk the sun? Just settle back at home and smoke.
Outside’s absurd, especially that whoop of joy,
you’ve made it to the lavatory--now head back straight away! 
Don’t leave your room, don’t go and hail a taxi, spend,
the only space that matters is the corridor, its end
a ticking meter. She comes by, all ready for caressing,
mouth open? Kick her straight out, don’t even start undressing. 
Don’t leave your room, just say you have the influenza.
A wall and table are the most fascinating agenda.
Why leave this place? Tonight you will come home from town
exactly as you were, only more beaten down. 
Don’t leave your room. Go dance the bossa nova,
shoes without socks, your body bare and coat tossed over. 
The hallway holds its smells of ski wax and boiled cabbage, 
writing even one letter more is excess baggage.  
Don’t leave your room. Do you still look handsome?
Just ask the room… Incognito ergo sum,
as petulant Substance once remarked to Form.
It’s not exactly France outside. Don’t leave your room!  
Don’t be an idiot! You’re not the others, you’re an exclusion!
Choreograph the furniture, essay wall-paper fusion. 
Make that wardrobe a barricade. The fates require us
to keep out Cosmos, Chronos, Eros, Race and Virus!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October has arrived - the woods have tossed
Their final leaves from naked branches;
A breath of autumn chill - the road begins to freeze,
The stream still murmurs as it passes by the mill,
The pond, however's frozen; and my neighbor hastens
to his far-flung fields with all the members of his hunt.
The winter wheat will suffer from this wild fun,
And baying hounds awake the slumbering groves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------              
This is my time: I am not fond of spring;
The tiresome thaw, the stench, the mud - spring sickens me.
The blood ferments, and yearning binds the heart and mind..
With cruel winter I am better satisfied,
I love the snows; when in the moonlight
A sleigh ride swift and carefree with a friend.
Who, warm and rosy 'neath a sable mantle,
Burns, trembles as she clasps your hand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What fun it is, with feet in sharp steel shod,
To skim the mirror of the smooth and solid streams!
And how about the shining stir of winter feasts? . .
But in the end you must admit that naught but snow
For half the year will even bore a bear
Deep in his den. We cannot ride for ages,
In sleighs with youthful nymphs 
Or sulk around the stove behind storm windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O, summer fair! I would have loved you, too,
Except for heat and dust and gnats and flies.
You kill off all our mental power,
Torment us; and like fields, we suffer from the drought;
To take a drink, refresh ourselves somehow -
We think of nothing else, and long for lady Winter,
And, having bid farewell to her with pancakes and with wine,
We hold a wake to honor her with ice-cream and with ice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latter days of fall are often cursed,
But as for me, kind reader, she is precious
In all her quiet beauty, mellow glow.
Thus might a child, disfavored in its family,
Draw my regard. To tell you honestly,
Of all the times of year, I cherish her alone.
She's full of worth; and I, a humble lover,
Have found in her peculiar charms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can this be explained? I favor her
As you might one day find yourself attracted
To a consumptive maid. Condemned to death,
The poor child languishes without complaint or anger.
A smile plays upon her withering lips;
She cannot sense as yet the gaping maw of death;
A crimson glow still flits across her face.
Today she lives, tomorrow she is gone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A melancholy time! So charming to the eye!
Your beauty in its parting pleases me -
I love the lavish withering of nature,
The gold and scarlet raiment of the woods,
The crisp wind rustling o'er their threshold,
The sky engulfed by tides of rippled gloom,
The sun's scarce rays, approaching frosts,
And gray-haired winter threatening from afar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When autumn comes, I bloom anew;
The Russian frost does wonders for my health;
Anew I fall in love with life's routine:
Betimes I'm soothed by dreams, betimes by hunger caught;
The blood flows free and easy in my heart,
Abrim with passion; once again, I'm happy, young,
I'm full of life - such is my organism
(Excuse me for this awful prosaism)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My horse is brought to me; in open field,
With flying mane, he carries fast his rider,
And with his shining hooves he hammers out a song
Upon the frozen, ringing vale, and crackling ice.
But fleeting day dies out, new fire comes alive
Inside the long-forgotten stove-- it blazes bright,
Then slowly smoulders - as I read before it,
Or nourish long and heartfelt thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I forget the world - in silence sweet,
I'm sweetly lulled by my imagination,
And poetry awakens deep inside:
My heart is churned with lyric agitation,
It trembles, moans, and strives, as if in sleep,
To pour out in the end a free statement-
And here they come - a ghostly swarm of guests,
My long-lost friends, the fruits of all my dream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My mind is overcome by dashing thoughts,
And rhymes come running eagerly to meet them,
My hand demands a pen; the pen - a sheet of paper.
Another minute - and my verse will freely flow.
Thus slumbers an immobile ship caught in immobile waters,
But lo! - the sailors rush all of a sudden, crawl
Up top, then down - sails billow, filled with wind;
The massive structure moves, and cuts the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patiently, as one grinds gravel
Patiently, as one awaits death,
Patiently, as news ripens,
Patiently, as one savors revenge - 
I will wait for you (fingers clinched- 
As a slave waits for his Queen)
Patiently, as one waits for rhymes,
Patiently, as one bites one's hands.
I will wait for you (gaze -to ground,
Teeth to lips.  Stupor.  Stone).
Patiently, as one prolongs bliss,
Patiently, as one strings beads.
The scrape of runners, the answering scrape
of a door: the roar of Taiga winds.
A royal decree arrives:
- Coup d'etat and the grandee is coming.
Homeward bound:
To the beyond -
Yet mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters heaviness and tenderness, your traits are one.
Bees and wasps suck the heavy rose.
Man dies. The heated sand cools,
And a black stretcher bears away yesterday's sun.
Ah, heavy honeycombs and tender seines,
One may sooner lift a stone than say your name!
For me a sole concern remains on earth:
A golden concern, to flee the burden of time.
I drink the clouded air like a dark stream.
Time's tilled by a plow, and a rose was the earth.
In the slow whirlpool are heavy, tender roses,
Weaving heaviness and tenderness into twin wreaths.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only snakes shed their skin,
So their souls can age and grow.
We, alas, do not resemble snakes,
We change souls, not bodies.
Memory, with the hand of a giantess
You lead life like a horse by the reins,
You will tell me about those who lived
In this body before it was mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first was plain and thin,
And loved only forests in twilight,
He was a fallen leaf, a magic child
Who stopped the rain with a word.
A tree and a red dog - 
These he took as friends.
Memory, memory, you will not find proof,
You will not convince the world he was me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second...He loved a wind from the south,
Heard the ring of the lyre in every noise,
Said that life was a friend to him,
And the world a carpet beneath his feet.
I don't like him at all, it was he
Who wanted to be God and king,
He hung the sign of a poet
Over the doors of my silent house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like freedom's chosen one,
The seafarer and rifleman.
Ah, the waters clearly sang to him
And the clouds were full of envy.
His tent was on high ground,
The mules were strong and frisky
He drank in like wine the sweet air 
Of a country unknown to the white man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, you weaken year to year,
Was it that one or another one
Who traded happy freedom
For a sacred, long-awaited battle.
He knew the pains of hunger and thirst,
Sleep disturbed, the endless road,
But St. George twice touched
His breast untouched by a bullet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am the somber and stubborn builder
Of a temple rising up in the gloom.
I covet the glory of Savaoth,
Both in heaven and on earth.
My heart will be scorched to the depths by flame
Until the day when the walls of the New Jerusalem
Will rise up clean
From the fields of my native land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then a peculiar wind will blow
And a terrible light will pour from the sky -
The Milky Way will unexpectedly bloom
Like a garden of blinding planets.
An unknown traveler will appear before me,
Hiding his face; but I'll understand all
When I see the lion following his tracks,
And the eagle flying toward him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will cry out...but who can prevent
My soul from dying?
Only snakes shed their skin
We change souls, not bodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the earth, what’s a body
but an excuse to cover
and hide leaves, snows
and forgetting beneath a veil?
Cease to be.
At dawn the birds cry
over every dying thing,
over ugliness and beauty.
At dawn they cry and dance.
O, heart, why do you kneel?
As if begging for alms.
You’ll be burned, your ash scattered,
no one will remember you.
And my heart responds:
“A burn from your shoulder remains
on my shoulder.”
An alien heart, the sun growing cold.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’m writing letters. To you. We spoke about them half the night.
Years pass.
Nerves are shot.
No one can be brought back.
You can scream as much as you want.
Cover the lamp.
You can lean against a tree trunk
and wait things out.
How much sky and air out there!
But nothing to breathe.
Your inner rain’s soaked everything –
your legs have stuck to your skirt hem,
bare legs, with thin streams of tendons.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We’re heading into the night. We’re shadows of ash
on transparent stallions.
The piebalds won’t budge.
They just wail and burn.
Whip the horses and see the scars,
scoop water from an empty pail.
Behind us, nothing but loss.
Sail off, but where to? – nothing around but soot.
Our dead are everywhere –
in the trees, blossoms and fetes.
That same ash in their mouths
won’t let them wake from death.
The light floods in, but wait; it’s hard
when night falls from your eyes.
When coals in place of hearts
die out and quickly turn to dust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps this is the fear of leaves on a fall day?
David the conqueror gropes the space through empty sockets;
he forgot that he turned to stone long ago and has nowhere to run.
The damp horizon looks like a potato sliced by a spade.
There’ll be snow tomorrow.  It will alter our faces, sewing solemn lines of wrinkles.
Winter’s white goats will wander the orchard, stripping bark from the apple trees,
and they’ll look into the windows where we warm our hands over a quiet geranium fire.
Such are the days here, like drops of water in a prisoner’s solitary cell.
And we are immobile, like David, our legs planted deep in the ground.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A voice bouncing off boarded-up windows, a quivering voice
within walls like well-driven nails.
A throaty voice, as if of a caged dove
groping through deaf darkness into bunches of hanging fingers. 
Through them, through the air heated by snow,
torn apart like fabric, like flesh that has known the scalpel.
How silent it is! Either a hot flash on the cheek
or simply snowflakes melting and rolling down like tears.
That voice! Free, unmaimed by wheels, not pursued,
edgy, floating beneath the damp stone vaults,
remarked only by the lightning glances of parishioners
who will remain in this blue twilight, today or tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The action continues by the water,
A fatal war, trenches, swords, cuirasses,
The Yids occupy the war’s left bank,
The faggots stand in formation on the right.
This battle takes place on foot, it will never end,
Will grind through and chew up five hundred generations,
Will have its own way, like a nuclear winter,
Because cavalry attacks them from the heavens,
While darkness comes on from under the ground,
Piercing the heel and poking the knees apart.
Each one of us stands on that bank or this.
Each one of us didn’t lay down arms at once.
Each one of us, long as we’re still alive,
Looks toward where the flag-bearers are consulting,
The riders whistle and shout back and forth,
Where willy-nilly you turn into a poet.
Let me join the Jews or the faggots,
I’ve been dreaming of this since third grade:
To become a stag or a ram for you,
A fatted calf or a pudgy aunt,
A maiden, miraculous in the bushes!
With a sword in my chest I sing and do not die
In the war waged on the foothills of paradise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The session begins, everything rustles,
They lead witnesses out and lead new ones in,
The sentence is delivered in haste,
The accused turns into the convicted.
The sentence is brought into action,
Usually with the doctor and the prison director.
They don’t allow relatives in here.
They don’t allow journalists in here either.
They let the convicted in here, one by one,
Arrange their shoulders, ankles and wrists,
Let them smoke one final cigarette,
Give them a shot, give them alternating current,
The convicted man turns into a bear.
The relatives don’t usually come to pick them up,
Although I do know of one exceptional case:
They keep it at the dacha, under guard, to live out its years.
The unclaimed ones are distributed to zoos,
To circus troupes, to private animal collections:
They aren’t aggressive, they can be trained well,
They walk on their hind legs, sometimes they say “Mama”.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful, quiet, or rather: she hardly knows Russian,
I like her surroundings, the gingerbread, sugar and all the halvah,
All and all manner of halvah that’s exuding praise,
When she’s in the corner and weighing out the goods.
Her fingers take tangerines by the sides, the freight
Of greenish, stepped-on, sweetly moaning pears – by the neck,
She loads the dark flesh of eggplant into the white
Flesh of rustling plastic; and the price list is born.
While the persimmon is like a mother to her, and she doesn’t look at it
And feels shame for her public profession.
I ask her a question, and she doesn’t give an answer.
I drop by like a thief, and she won’t restrain the thief.
Her weak, her cheap labor force
Is all gathered in her arms and won’t tolerate conversation.
Her father and everyone’s will descend upon us like an avalanche,
The moment she doesn’t turn out to be a virgin.
Her father and everyone’s, the elder guide,
Head doctor of an empty mountain hospital,
Where someone’s ribs, like the mother’s womb, are stretched
And fear pulls apart eyelashes that were squeezed flat.
Her father and everyone’s, he’s coming after his dotter,
Along the dark route he stretches by day and by night, 
Like a stripe of fug on a train car’s walls.
When his armies make their way into the city,
And stick like a bone in the throat by Red Square,
And go along ambulance roads, easing their hunger,
Taking the fox-fur coats off the homespun poor,
We’ll wait for them beneath the mound,
Where Yulia the manager swore at her today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They still allow us to smoke in the office,
They get it: this kind of work, you have to smoke,
They run after one as he’s walking: hey, commander,
The second from the table raises his eyes to the door,
The second one from the trial raises his eyes to a hook,
There the lamp’s swaying back and forth, Svetlana, what’ll I say
When the earth quakes, and the ground opens its mouth,
And the arrested earn their execution?
The third one stands up, decorated, and he has everything,
But they’ve called him, and he goes.
“Look for me at dawn”, he said to his comrades,
As if he and they are he and someone else
Who’s alone, like Job, and waits for him like for a storm.
What’s that blue sign on his arm, sister?
That’s a powerful sign on his arm, girlfriend.
There it sort of says: beloved,
My darling, take care of yourself, don’t use in front of everyone,
Give your parents a call, take time off on Wednesday,
If you don’t take it – try to behave yourself,
And if there’s anything call, if there’s anything call for me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t wait for us, my darling
Me and my friend been took.
Reporting back from the front, sir:
There’s war wherever you look.
We’re based down in a basement
In the deepest depths of the clay
They’re throwing flames above us
But we’ve gone away
Some arrived only lately
Some at the beginning of time
All of them flat as playing cards
Fallen in the grime.
And the earth that flows between us
is thick as wine.
We were men but now
We’re amino acids in soup
The smell of tears and sperm
And bonemeal and gloop
And me I’m singed at the edges
A piece of felted wool 
The one who stood at the window with you
Is made of deep hole.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last songs are assembling,
Soldiers of a ghostly front:
Escaping from surrounded places
A refrain or two make a break for it
Appearing at the rendez-vous
Looking about them, like the hunted.
How stiffly unbending they are
Running water won’t soften them now!
How unused they are to company
The words don’t form as they ought.
But their elderly, skillful hands
Pass the cartridges round,
And until first light their seeing fingers
Reassemble Kalashnikovs,
They draw, with sharp intake of breath
From wounds, the deeply lodged letters –
And towards morning, avoiding checkpoints,
They enter the sleepless city.
In times of war, they fall silent.
When the muses roar, they fall silent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rain in Rotterdam. Dusk. Environment.
Opening the hood, I raise the gate.
Four days later they bombed the city,
and the city was gone. Cities
not people and not hiding in the stairwell
during a downpour. Streets, houses
not converge in these cases, the mind
and, falling, do not call for vengeance.
The July afternoon. Drips from the wafer
on the trouser leg. Chorus of children's voices.
Around - the huge new buildings.
In Corbusier something in common with the Luftwaffe,
Both have worked from the heart
over the variable shape of Europe.
What pozabudut furious Cyclops,
a sober finish pencils.
As the time nor healthily, but the stump,
seeing no means different from the goals,
smart. And the stronger - from a panacea.
Night. Three decades later,
We drink wine with big old star
in an apartment on the twentieth floor -
at the level achieved already
soaring here once on the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wind from the northwestern quarter is lifting him high above
the dove-gray, crimson, umber, brown
Connecticut Valley. Far beneath,
chickens daintily pause and move
unseen in the yard of the tumbledown
farmstead, chipmunks blend with the heath.
Now adrift on the airflow, unfurled, alone,
all that he glimpses--the hills' lofty, ragged
ridges, the silver stream that threads
quivering like a living bone
of steel, badly notched with rapids,
the townships like strings of beads
strewn across New England. Having slid down to nil
thermometers--those household gods in niches--
freeze, inhibiting thus the fire
of leaves and churches' spires. Still,
no churches for him. In the windy reaches,
undreamt of by the most righteous choir,
he soars in a cobalt-blue ocean, his beak clamped shut,
his talons clutched tight into his belly
--claws balled up like a sunken fist--
sensing in each wisp of down the thrust
from below, glinting back the berry
of his eyeball, heading south-southeast
to the Rio Grande, the Delta, the beech groves and farther still:
to a nest hidden in the mighty groundswell
of grass whose edges no fingers trust,
sunk amid forest's odors, filled
with splinters of red-speckled eggshell,
with a brother or a sister's ghost.
The heart overgrown with flesh, down, feather, wing,
pulsing at feverish rate, nonstopping,
propelled by internal heat and sense,
the bird goes slashing and scissoring
the autumnal blue, yet by the same swift token,
enlarging it at the expense
of its brownish speck, barely registering on the eye,
a dot, sliding far above the lofty
pine tree; at the expense of the empty look
of that child, arching up at the sky,
that couple that left the car and lifted
their heads, that woman on the stoop.
But the uprush of air is still lifting him
higher and higher. His belly feathers
feel the nibbling cold. Casting a downward gaze,
he sees the horizon growing dim,
he sees, as it were, the features
of the first thirteen colonies whose
chimneys all puff out smoke. Yet it's their total within his sight
that tells the bird of his elevation,
of what altitude he's reached this trip.
What am I doing at such a height?
He senses a mixture of trepidation
and pride. Heeling over a tip
of wing, he plummets down. But the resilient air
bounces him back, winging up to glory,
to the colorless icy plane.
His yellow pupil darts a sudden glare
of rage, that is, a mix of fury
and terror. So once again
he turns and plunges down. But as walls return
rubber balls, as sins send a sinner to faith, or near,
he's driven upward this time as well!
He! whose innards are still so warm!
Still higher! Into some blasted ionosphere!
That astronomically objective hell
of birds that lacks oxygen, and where the milling stars
play millet served from a plate or a crescent.
What, for the bipeds, has always meant
height, for the feathered is the reverse.
Not with his puny brain but with shriveled air sacs
he guesses the truth of it: it's the end.
And at this point he screams. From the hooklike beak
there tears free of him and flies [ad luminem]
the sound Erinyes make to rend
souls: a mechanical, intolerable shriek,
the shriek of steel that devours aluminum;
"mechanical," for it's meant
for nobody, for no living ears:
not man's, not yelping foxes',
not squirrels' hurrying to the ground
from branches; not for tiny field mice whose tears
can't be avenged this way, which forces
them into their burrows. And only hounds
lift up their muzzles. A piercing, high-pitched squeal,
more nightmarish than the D-sharp grinding
of the diamond cutting glass,
slashes the whole sky across. And the world seems to reel
for an instant, shuddering from this rending.
For the warmth burns space in the highest as
badly as some iron fence down here
brands incautious gloveless fingers.
We, standing where we are, exclaim
"There!" and see far above the tear
that is a hawk, and hear the sound that lingers
in wavelets, a spider skein
swelling notes in ripples across the blue vault of space
whose lack of echo spells, especially in October,
an apotheosis of pure sound.
And caught in this heavenly patterned lace,
starlike, spangled with hoarfrost powder,
silver-clad, crystal-bound,
the bird sails to the zenith, to the dark-blue high
of azure. Through binoculars we foretoken
him, a glittering dot, a pearl.
We hear something ring out in the sky,
like some family crockery being broken,
slowly falling aswirl,
yet its shards, as they reach our palms, don't hurt
but melt when handled. And in a twinkling
once more one makes out curls, eyelets, strings,
rainbowlike, multicolored, blurred
commas, ellipses, spirals, linking
heads of barley, concentric rings--
the bright doodling pattern the feather once possessed,
a map, now a mere heap of flying
pale flakes that make a green slope appear
white. And the children, laughing and brightly dressed,
swarm out of doors to catch them, crying
with a loud shout in English, "Winter's here!"
