Do not leave the room, do not make a mistake.
What use is the sun to you, if you smoke Shipka?
Everything behind the door is senseless, especially the cry of happiness.
Only to the dressing room — and immediately return.
Do not leave the room, do not call the engine.
Because the space is made of corridors
and ends with a counter. And if a living soul enters
a doll, falling, eating, without removing her clothes.
Do not leave the room; think that you have been drowned.
What is more interesting than a wall and a chair?
Why go out from there, where you will return in the evening
the same as you were, the more you’ve been tarnished?
Oh, don’t leave the room. Dance, catching the barefoot
in a coat for naked body, in shoes for bare feet.
The hall smells of cabbage and ski oil.
You have written many letters; one more will be superfluous.
Don’t leave the room. Oh, let only this room
I guess what you look like. And in general, incognito
Ergo-sums, as the substance of hearts has noticed the form.
Do not leave the room! In the street, tea, not France.
Don’t be a fool! Be what others were not.
Do not leave the room! Let the furniture be free,
merge face to face with the walls. Stop and barricade yourself
the wardrobe of chronosis, cosmos, eros, race, virus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October has come — the grove shakes away
The last leaves from its naked branches;
The cold of autumn has breathed — the road will freeze.
The rush is still running behind the windmill of the brook,
But the pond is already frozen; my neighbor hurries
Into the fields away with their hunting,
And suffer with lakes from frenzied amusement,
And the barking of dogs awakens the sleeping trees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now is my time: I do not love spring;
The thaw is dull to me; foam, dirt — in the spring I’m sick;
The blood wanders; the feelings, the mind, are constrained by anguish.
I’m more satisfied with the harsh winter,
I love her snow; in the presence of the moon
Like a sleigh’s swift and free race with a friend,
When under the pine trees, warm and fresh,
She clasps your hand, trembling and burning!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How merry, with legs of iron sharpened,
To slide down the mirror of the standing, level rivers!
And the brilliant worries of winter holidays?..
But one must also know honour: six months of snow and snow,
For this, at last, is for the inhabitant of Berlin,
Bear, you’ll be bored. You can’t live forever
We ride in sleighs with the young Armidas
Or to oxidize in the furnaces behind double glazed panes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, red summer! I would love you,
If only there weren’t heat, dust, mosquitoes and flies.
You, losing all your spiritual faculties,
You torment us; like fields, we suffer from drought;
Just how to drink, and refresh myself —
There is no other thought in us, and I pity the old woman of winter,
And, escorting her with gleams and wine,
We treat it with ice-cream and with icing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The days of late autumn curse as usual,
But she’s dear to me, reader of the road,
With quiet beauty that shines humbly.
Thus, in a dear family, an unloved child
Draws me to myself. To tell you frankly,
Of all times of the year, I’m glad for her alone,
There is much good in it; the lover is not vain,
I found something in it, a dream of my own.
</span style="margin-left: 160px;">
How can I explain this? I like her,
How, probably, to you the maiden with a nose
At times I like it. I’m condemned to death,
The beggar bows without anger, without complaining.
A smile is visible on lips that have withered;
She does not hear the call of the graveyard’s abyss;
The crimson color plays on my face.
She’s still alive today, but not tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sad hour! Eyes’ enchantment!
I like your farewell beauty —
I love the luxuriant decay of nature,
The forests dressed in crimson and gold,
In their haylofts the wind’s noise and fresh breath,
And the heavens are covered with wavy mist,
And the rare rays of sun, and the first frosts,
And threats of the distant gray-haired winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And with each autumn I bloom again;
Russian cold is useful to my health;
Again I feel my love for the habits of life:
In sequence sleep flies, seeks hunger in turn;
The blood plays lightly and joyfully in the heart,
Desires boil — I am happy, young again,
I am full of life once more — such is my body
(Allow me to forgive the useless prose).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They lead a horse to me; in the open valley,
He bears a horseman with his mane,
And ringing, beneath his shining hooves,
The frozen valley sounds and the ice cracks.
But the brief day will fade, and in the forgotten chamber
The flame burns again, then a bright light casts,
Now it’s fading slowly, and I’m reading in front of it
Or nourish my soul with long thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I forget the world — even in the sweet silence
I am sweetly asleep with my reflection,
And poetry awakens in me:
The soul is stifled by a lyrical wave,
Trembles and sounds, and seeks, as in a dream,
To melt into free expression at last —
And here comes to me an invisible swarm of guests,
Old acquaintances, the fruits of my dreams.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the thoughts in my head are stirred in daring,
And light rhymes run to meet them,
And fingers are pressed to the pen, pen to paper,
A minute — and verses flow freely.
Thus drowses the immovable ship in the motionless water,
But alas! — the sailors suddenly bow, crawl
Up, down — and the sails have swelled, full of wind;
The haze has moved and is cutting off the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patiently, as if they were beating gravel,
Patiently, as one waits for death,
Patiently, as news ripens,
Patiently, as they cherish vengeance —
I’ll wait for you (fingers pressing
Thus the monarch's concubine waits)
Patiently, as one waits for rhymes,
Patiently, as hands fold.
I’ll wait for you (looking at the ground,
Teeth on lips. A stool. An owl).
Patiently, as one endures bliss,
Patiently, as beads are peeled.
The creaking of twigs, the replying creak
Doors: the roar of the mountain winds.
The highest scripture has come:
“Reform of the kingdom and entry of a nobleman.
And home:
In the unearthly —
And mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters — gravity and tenderness — your signs are the same.
Honeycombs and wasps suck the heavy rose.
Man dies. The warm sand cools,
And yesterday’s sun is carried on a black stretcher.
Ah, heavy honeycombs and tender nets,
It is easier to lift a stone than to repeat your name!
I have one care left in this world, and that is this:
The golden care, how to bear the burden of time.
Like dark water, I drink the smothered air.
Time was ploughed, and the rose was earth.
In the slow whirlpool the heavy gentle roses,
The rose’s weight and tenderness have stuck to the twin wreaths!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only snakes cast off their skins,
For the soul to grow and age.
Alas, we are not like snakes,
We change souls, not bodies.
Memory, you with the hand of a giant
You lead your life as if under a horse’s hooves,
You will tell me about those who once
In this body lived before me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first: ugly and thin,
Who loved only the grove of dusk,
The fallen leaf, a child of sorcery,
The rain that has stopped with a word.
A tree and a red-haired dog —
Here is the one whom he took as his friend,
Memory, memory, you will not find a sign,
The world will not believe that it was I.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second... He loved the wind from the south,
In every noise I heard the ringing of the lyres,
He said that life is his friend,
Under his feet the stone is world.
It doesn’t please me at all, it’s
He wanted to become a god and a king,
He hung the sign of the poet
Above the doors of my silent house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the freedom's chosen one,
Of a seafarer and an archer,
Ah, to him the waters sang so ringingly
And the clouds envy.
His tent was high and tall,
The moths were fierce and strong,
Like wine, it drinks the sweet air
To the white of an unknown land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, you are weaker year by year,
Was it he or someone else
I traded cheerful liberty
For the sacred and long-awaited battle.
He knew the pangs of hunger and thirst,
The uneasy sleep, the endless path,
But St. George touched twice
Not touched by bullets, I’m bleeding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a sullen and stubborn architect
Of a temple that rises in the dark,
I extolled my Father's glory,
As in the heavens, and on the earth.
The heart will be a flaming flame
Up to the day when they will rise, clear,
The walls of New Jerusalem
On the fields of my native land.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then a strange wind will blow —
And a dreadful light will shed from the sky,
This Milky Way has blossomed unexpectedly
The garden of blinding planets.
Will appear before me, I do not know,
A stranger, hiding his face; but I will understand
Seeing a lion chasing after him,
And an eagle flying toward him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I scream... but will someone help me,
So that my soul doesn’t die?
Only snakes cast off their skins,
We change souls, not bodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That the body is for the earth,
as if there’s no reason to hide
and hide beneath the cover
of leaves, snow, oblivion –
Not to be.
Every bird weeps at dawn
about everyone who lies with a white bone,
About beauty and vulgarity.
And weeps, and dances at dawn.
Why did you kneel, my heart?
And you ask for alms, as if.
They will burn you down and scatter your dust —
No one will remember.
And my heart responds to me:
“The flame from your shoulder remained
on my shoulder."
The heart of a stranger, the sun that freezes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I write letters. To you. Of which the midnights spoke.
Years go by.
The nettles are pierced by a needle.
And no one will be returned.
You can shout as much as you want.
To wave the lamp.
You can press your back against a half-tree
and to wait.
So much sky and air!
There’s nothing to breathe.
The rain has drenched everything —
my feet were glued to the bottom,
their naked feet, their thin veins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Into the night. We are ashes of ash
riding ghostly horses.
The wretched ones are nowhere, from no place,
but only weep and burn.
To see the horses and the scars on their faces,
and pluck from the empty bottom.
Behind my back there are only losses.
Where are you going? – Around the ash.
And our dead everywhere —
in trees, on holidays, in flowers.
Death does not let me awake
The same ash on their lips.
And the light pours out: how hard it is,
when night leaves my eyes.
And instead of heart, coal will burn out,
and scattered instantly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it perhaps the fear of leaves on an autumn day?
With empty eye sockets David the conqueror feels the space;
he forgot that he’d turned to stone long ago, and he had nowhere to run.
The arid horizon, like a potato cut by a shovel.
Tomorrow the snow will fall. It will change our faces, sewing wrinkles with stern threads.
The white goats of winter will trample our garden, eating corn from apple trees,
and look out the window, where we warm our hands over the quiet fire of the geraniums.
Such are the days here, like drops in a solitary cell.
And we, motionless, like David, with two feet have grown into this earth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The voice that bangs on the blind windows, the trembling voice,
Into these walls, as if nailed not by chance.
A voice from the throat, like a dove from a nest,
encountering in the crowd the deaf, the fingers whistling clusters.
Between them, between, into the snow-blasted air,
like cloth, like flesh, recognizing the scalpel.
What silence! Is it hot on the cheek, or is it simply
flakes melt from the sky and roll down it like drops.
The voice! Not understood, not crushed by the wheels, nor driven,
under the moistened stone of the vaults.
Following are only the gazes of passers-by, today, tomorrow,
remaining in the blue twilight of their arrival.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The action continues by the water,
War is not for life, trenches, swords, barracks,
The Jews occupy the left bank of the war,
On the right wall, there are tomatoes.
This battle goes on foot, never ending,
Five hundred generations will be overgrown and bruised,
Stands on its own, like a nuclear winter,
Because from the sky they are attacked by a cavalcade,
And from beneath the earth comes darkness,
Piercing their heels and spreading their knees apart.
Each of us stands on this or that.
Each of us did not immediately lay down his arms.
Each one of us, while still alive,
Looks to where the people of the hills are advising,
The horsemen whistle and rejoice,
Where involuntarily you become a poet.
Take me in a suit of jewels or pimentos,
I’ve been dreaming about this since the third grade:
To become a stag or a ram for you,
With a sacrificial calf or a fat one,
A maiden, revealed in the bushes!
I sing with a sword in my breast and do not die
In the war that's on its way to heaven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The meeting begins, everything rustles,
They bring forth witnesses and introduce new ones,
The penultimate sentence is carried out,
The accused turns into the convicted.
The verdict is carried out,
At the same time, usually, the doctor and the prison governor.
They don’t let relatives here.
They don’t let journalists here either.
One by one, convicted men are thrown out of here,
Shoulders, ankles and wrists are fixed,
They let me smoke my last cigarette,
They’re given a blow, a changeable current,
The condemned one turns into a bear.
Their relatives don’t usually take them away,
Though I know of an exceptional case:
On the dacha, guarded, they hold the forest to the edge.
The unclaimed are scattered through zoos,
To circus groups, to private living corners:
They are unaggressive, well-trained,
They walk on the back, “Mommy” they sometimes say.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful, silent, that is, in Russian hardly ever,
I like its surroundings, herbs, sugar and all the chalk,
Every shawl exhausts its praise,
When she’s in the corner and hangs out merchandise.
Her fingers are taken by the orange trees at her side, by her neck — the burden
Greenish, stacked, sweetly moaning rush,
She plunges the dark flesh of a kiss into the white
The crunching flesh of plastic; and a price tag is born.
But she’s a mother to him, and she doesn’t look at him
And is ashamed of his public profession.
I ask her a question, and she gives no answer.
I walk in like a thief, and she won’t hold back the thieves.
Its weakness, its cheap labor force
She’s gathered in her arms and can’t stand the conversation.
She and her common father will descend on the lane, like an avalanche,
She hardly proves to be innocent.
She and her common father, the eldest leader,
The chief physician of an empty hospital on high,
Where someone’s ribcage, as lithe as a lily,
And fear breeds flattened eyelashes.
She and the common father, he is waiting for his daughter,
Night and day, along the dark road it drags,
Like a streak of mist at the train’s walls.
When his armies enter the city
And will become a bone in the throat of Red Square
And swift they will go on their way, quenching hunger,
Taking off their coats by the carriage’s throat,
We will wait for them at the bottom of the mound,
Where the manager of Yulya today scolded her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the department they still allow us to smoke,
They understand: this is work, we must smoke,
They catch up with one on the move: hey, commander,
The second from the table lifts his eyes to the door,
The second from the court lifts his eyes to the hook,
There is a lamp here and there, Svetlana, what shall I say,
When earth shakes, and the soil opens its mouth,
And stab the arrested in the wall?
The third rises, he has merit, and all is with him,
But they call, and he goes on his way.
“Wait for me at dawn,” he tells his comrades,
It’s as if he and they are one and the same,
Who is like Job and waits for him like a storm.
What is the blue sign on his hand, sister?
This is a strong sign on his hand, my friend.
It says something like this: Beloved,
My beloved, you, guard yourself, don’t take in everyone’s sight,
Call your parents, take a break on Wednesday,
You won’t take it — try to behave yourself well
And call, if anything, call me if any.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not wait for us at home, my darling,
Not a friend, not me.
I report the situation:
There is one war all around.
We’re basing ourselves in the earthquake
At the bottom of the earth,
Above us the fireflies are beating,
But we have left them behind.
And those who were here not long ago,
And those, who long ago,
Lay in the dark, like a domino,
And they listen to their movies
And between us the earth flows
Thick as wine.
We used to be people. Now we are
White ear,
We smell of tears and semen,
And roots, and dew.
And I myself am only a clot,
Burned to the brim,
And he, who stood with you at the window,
consists of deep pits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last songs are gathered up,
The soldiers of the invisible front:
Emerging from the surroundings,
Two or three lines flee from captivity,
Appear at the meeting place,
Looking bloodstainedly at me.
How they blackened,
Can’t be washed away with water!
How they were clothed,
Can’t say in Russian.
But with ancient, skillful hands
They’re handing out their guns,
Before the light, with eyesighty fingers,
They recollect the "cathedrals,"
Drain me from my wound,
Letters that have been sown so deeply —
And at dawn, bypassing the fortress,
They enter the sleepless city.
And are silent, while the cannons rumble.
And are silent, while the muses are roaring.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s raining in Rotterdam. Twilight. Wednesday.
Opening the umbrella, I lift up the gate.
For four days they bombed the city,
and the city is gone. Cities –
not people are hiding in the porch
during the rain. Streets, houses
don’t lose their minds in these instances
and, falling, do not call for revenge.
Midday in July. The waffle drizzles
on a razor blade. A chorus of children’s voices.
Huge new buildings surround us.
The Corbusier has something in common with Luftwaffe,
that both of us have laboured from our hearts
Above the change of Europe’s image.
That the cyclops will forget in their rage,
or the pencils will finish with a touch of care.
No matter how healing it is, but by worshipping,
Seeing no means to distinguish it from its aim,
Saddles. And the stronger it is — from panacea.
Night. Three decades later,
we drink wine by the large summer stars
in an apartment on the twentyth floor –
at a level already achieved
that once flew into the air here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The north-western wind lifts it above
blue, purple, crimson, red
across the Connecticut valley. He’s already
The sumptuous promenade does not see
The hens in the weathered yard
of a farm, a hedge on the boundary.
On the airy stream, scattered, lonely,
All that he sees is for him to come
the hills and the river’s silver,
like a living blade that snaps,
steel in jagged overflows,
towns like beads
Of New England. Those who have fallen to zero
The thermometers are like purples in a niche;
freeze, putting aside the fire,
of leaves, spires of churches, But for
a hawk, it’s not a church. Above
a parson of the finest notions,
he hovers in the blue ocean, his beak twitching,
pressed to his plush waist,
- claws on fists, just like the fingers of hands -
Feeling with each feather blown
down below, sharpening in response the eye’s
with a berry, held to the South,
to Rio Grande, to the delto, in the open crowd
of bushes, hiding in the foam,
grass, whose blades are sharp,
a nest, a broken shell
in a lilac droplet, a scent, the shadows
a brother or a sister.
The heart, encrusted with flesh, plumage, feathers, wings,
that beats with a frequency of trembling,
as if with scissors,
that moves with its own warmth,
the autumn blue, its very essence
Increasing at the expense
not a brown spot that’s visible to the eye,
a point sliding on top of a vertex
at the expense of emptiness in the face
a child, frozen by the window,
of a couple who left the car,
a woman on the porch.
But its rising stream lifts it upwards
higher and higher. In the feathers beneath
shivers in the cold. Looking down,
he sees that the horizon has dimmed,
he sees as if the first thirteen
of states, he sees: from
the smoke of chimneys rises. But just the number
the chimney’s lonely beam,
to a bird, as if it had risen.
Wherever it has carried me!
He feels a mixture of uneasiness
pride. Turning over
a wing, it falls down, But the elastic layer
returns its air to the sky,
Into the ice’s colorless smooth.
In the yellow pupil there arises an evil
gleam. That is, a mixture of anger
with horror. He once again
is thrown down. But like a wall — a ball,
like a sinner’s falling into faith again,
pushes him back and forth.
His, who is still hot!
Into the devil that is the Highest. To the ionosphere.
Into the astronomically objective hell
birds, where oxygen is lacking,
where, instead of millet, the grain of distant
of stars. That for two-legged heights,
or the other way round for the feathers.
Not as a mosaic, but in light sacks
he guesses: there’s no escape.
And then he screams. From the bend, like a hook,
a beak, like a screech of lilies,
is torn and flies outwards
mechanical, unendurable sound,
the sound of steel plunged in aluminum;
mechanical, for it’s not
for no one’s ears:
of people, falling from the birch tree
the whiteness of the lightening fountain,
of little field mice;
so the tears cannot be shed
to no one. Only dogs
their muzzles. A piercing, sharp cry
more terrible, more nightmarish than re-digestion
a diamond cutting the glass,
crosses the sky. And for a moment the world
as if trembling from a cut.
For up above there is warmth
ignites the space, as here, down below,
a black fence burns his hand
Without gloves. We, crying,
there!" we see a tear from above
a hawk, plus a spider, to the sound
the depths of the ocean’s shallows,
running through the vault of the sky, where
there is no echo where apotheosis smells
Of sound, especially in October.
And in this lace, akin to a star,
hardening, frost-bound,
and in the silver
the bird, with its feathers down, glides into the sky,
in the ultramarine. In binoculars we see
a pearl, a glittering detail.
We hear: something above is ringing,
like broken tableware,
like a familiar crystal,
whose splinters, however, do not hurt, but
melt into palms. And for a moment
Again you discern the circles, the eyes,
a fan, a rainbow spot,
punctuation, parentheses, connections,
hair, ears, and feet —
the pen’s former random pattern,
a map that has become a rugged hand
Of cotton, flying on the hill’s slope.
And catching them with my fingers,
runs out into the street in a colorful jacket
and screams in English, "Winter, winter!"
