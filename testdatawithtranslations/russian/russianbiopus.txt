Stay out of the room, don't make a mistake.
Why would the Sun shine on you if you smoke Shipka?
There's nothing meaningful behind the door, especially a happy-looking noise.
Just go to the bathroom and come back straight away.
Oh, don't go out of the room, do not call the engine.
Because the space is made of a corridor.
and ends with a counter, and if a live one comes in
My dear, don't take your nose out of my mouth.
Don't go out of the room, you think you're sick.
What's more interesting than a wall and a chair?
Why go out when you're back tonight?
The same as you were, even more exalted?
Oh, don't leave the room.
in a coat on a bare body, in shoes on the bare foot.
The hall smells of cabbage and ski oil.
You've written a lot of letters; one more will be necessary.
Don't leave the room.
Guess what you look like.
As I noticed the shape in the hearts of the substance.
Don't leave the room!
Don't be a fool!
Don't leave the room!
Get away and barricade yourself.
A cabinet from the Chronos, space, the Heros, race, virus.

October is coming, and the fields are turning gray.
The last leaves of their branches,
The cold of the autumn leaves the road freezing.
The mist is still running in the mill pit,
But the pond is already frozen; my neighbor is hurrying.
And out of the fields with his hunting,
And they shall be freed from the thrill of play,
And the sound of dogs barking like ducks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now it is my turn: I do not like the spring;
I'm sick of the heat; the smell and the dirt make me sick in the spring.
Blood is running; feelings, wits are weary.
I'm more satisfied in the cold winter,
I love her snow; in the presence of the moon
Like a light run with a friend fast and free,
When it is warm and fresh underneath,
She's shaking your hand, shivering and trembling!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How fun it is to shoe iron with sharp legs,
Slipping through the mirrors of standing rivers!
And the winter holidays are brilliant alarms?
But you have to know and honor; six months of snow and ice,
For it is to the inhabitants of the crypt,
You can't wait a century.
Catch us in the saddle with Armidas Jr.
Or chow down in a cookie jar over a double glazed window.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, summer's in the red!
When there is no light, no dust, and no mosquitoes and flies.
You, with all your psychic powers,
You torment us like fields, we suffer from drought;
It's just a way to refresh myself.
There is no other thought in us, and I pity the winters of old lady,
And with pancakes and wine,
We give her a break with ice cream and frosting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The days of the late autumn mourn,
But I like it, reader dear,
Beautiful, quiet, humble.
Such a lonely child in a family
I'm attracted to myself.
Of all the years of my life, she's the only one I'm happy with.
There is much good in it, and the lover is not vain,
I found something in it, a dream of mine.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Y1Y2IwU
I like her,
Like you're probably a pussycat girl.
I love it. Sentenced to death,
The poor thing does it without hesitation, without anger.
The smile on the lips of the wounded is visible;
She does not hear the noise of the valley.
She's got a patchy patch on her face.
She's alive today, not tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a bad time!
I like your goodbye glory
I love the fragrant nature of witchcraft,
And the forests of the Bohemian and the golden,
And in the midst of the wind there is a sound and a fresh breath,
And the heavens are covered with a wavelength,
And the rare ray of the sun, and the first frost,
And distant winters threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And every fall I bloom again;
My health is benefited by the Russian cold;
To the habits of life I feel love:
A dream flies, a hunger strikes;
It is easy and joyful to play the blood in the heart
I'm happy again, young man.
I'm full of life again - that's my body
(Let me forgive the unnecessary prose.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They bring a horse to me; in the midst of the open,
He's carrying a rider.
And it's ringing under his shiny coat.
It's raining cold and ice cracking.
But a brief day goes away, and in a cup of forgotten
The fire is burning again, and the bright light shines,
It shines slowly, and I read before it.
Or do I have long conversations in my shower?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And forget the world - and in sweet silence
I'm soaked in my imagination,
And poetry engulfs me:
The soul is embarrassed by the lyrical waves,
It's coming and going, and looking like a dream.
To become finally free to manifest,
And there comes to me an invisible roar of guests,
Friendships of old, fruits of my dream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And thoughts in my head worrying in devotion,
And the rhymes of the lungs fleeing to them,
And their fingers are drawn to the pen, and their pen to paper,
One minute and the poems will flow freely.
So the ship is immovable in the vault,
But fu! - the sailors suddenly throw up, roam.
Up and down, and the sails are full of wind;
The storm has moved in and spreads the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As gentle as a squirrel,
As they wait for death patiently,
As soon as the tidings come,
As the wrath of the evildoers spreads,
I'll be waiting for you.
So the Monarchie is waiting for a concubine.
As the rhymes wait,
Slowly, as the hands cling.
I'll wait for you
Tooth in mouth.
As gentle as the wind blows,
Patience like a beaver.
Screaming of the foxes, the answering screams
Doors: the roars of the southern winds.
The highest is the Rescript:
- Change of kingdom and entry of the Duke.
And home:
In the inland,
Oh, my God.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters, gravity and tenderness are the same signs.
Honeys and bushes make a heavy rose.
The man dies.
And they put yesterday's sun on their black leggings.
Ah, heavy coats and delicate nets,
It's easier to lift a rock than to repeat your name!
There's only one thing I care about:
It's a gold oath, a burden to bear.
Like dark water, I drink smokeless air.
The time was laid out by the plough, and the rose was in the ground.
In a slow wavelength heavy soft roses
Roses are heavy and soft in double veins!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only snakes take off their skins,
To make the soul grow old.
We're not going out with the snakes,
We're changing souls, not bodies.
Remember, you're the hand of a giant.
Life is like riding a horse,
You're gonna tell me about those before.
This body was before me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first one is ugly and dull,
The one who loves only the desert,
The leaves are dry, the child is a sorcerer.
By the way, it stopped raining.
The tree and the red dog
That's who he made his friends with.
Memory, memory, you will not find a sign,
You can't assure the world that it was me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second... he loved the wind from the south,
I heard the bells ringing in every noise,
He said life was his friend,
The crab under his feet is the world.
I don't like him at all, it's...
He wanted to be God and king,
He hung a poster of a poet.
Over the doors of my silent house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the lover of liberty,
The fighter and the shooter,
Oh, he was singing so loudly.
And the clouds were envy.
His tent was high,
The moons were fierce and strong,
Like wine, he drank the air sweet
White to an unknown country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, you are weaker year by year,
Whether it's him or someone else.
He's been on a fun leap.
To a sacred long-awaited battle.
He knew the pain of hunger and thirst,
The dream is a troubled, endless journey,
But Saint George touched him twice.
My breasts are not touched.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a loud and stubborn builder.
A temple rising instantaneously,
I cried for the glory of the Father,
Like in the heavens and the earth.
Heart will be flaming flamingo
Till the day when they come up, clear,
New Jerusalem Walls
In the fields of my native country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then a strange wind blows
And a terrible light will fall from the sky,
This Milky Way bloomed unexpectedly.
Garden of blinding planets.
It will come to me, I do not know,
The traveler, concealing his face; but I understand.
Seeing a lion chasing a trail,
And an eagle flying towards him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll scream... but who's gonna help,
So my soul doesn't die?
Only snakes take off their skins,
We're changing souls, not bodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That body for the earth,
Not a reason to hide.
and hide under cover
The leaves, the snows and the dust –
No way.
Any bird cries at dawn
For every one who lays down his white hand,
about beauty and youth.
And she cries and dances at dawn.
Why are you on your knees, heart?
And you ask for mercy like that.
You will be burned and scattered.
No one will remember.
And my heart says to me,
"The burn from your shoulder remained
on my shoulder."
A beautiful heart, a scorching sun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm writing letters to you, the one you were talking about at midnight.
Years go by.
The ribs are in a needle.
And nobody gets back.
You can scream as much as you want.
I'm going to make a run for it.
You can lean back on the tree.
and wait.
There's so much heaven and air!
There's no breath.
The inside rain got all wet.
My feet are tied to the ground,
Naked legs with thick strings of cord.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're in the night.
A ride on ghostly horses.
They're stubborn, never moving.
but only cry and burn.
To ride the horses and see the scars,
and draw from the empty seas.
There's only loss behind that.
Swim, but where?
And our dead are everywhere
in trees, in holidays, and in flowers.
I can't sleep from death.
They have the same smoke in their mouths.
And when the light goes out, wait, how hard
When the night comes out of your eyes.
And in the place of the heart burns the coal,
and dissolves at once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe it's the fear of leaves on autumn day?
With his empty eyes, the victor David senses the space.
He forgets he's long gone, and he has nowhere to run.
Cheese horizon, like cutting a potato with a shovel.
It's gonna snow tomorrow, and it'll change our faces, shave our wrinkles.
The white goats will pass through our garden in winter, eating the corn from the tree,
and they will look through the windows, where we warm our hands over the silent flames of the geranium.
These days are like droppings in a solitary confinement.
And we were moved, as David, two feet in the earth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A voice whispering into the blind windows, a trembling voice,
in these walls, as if they weren't accidentally nailed.
The voice of the throat, as if it were a dove,
to the deaf, the fingers of the thunderbolts.
Between them, between, in the snowy air,
as a tissue, as flesh, recognising the scalpel.
It's quieter on the cheek.
The droppings from the sky are melted and rolled over it in the form of droplets.
The voice is not caught, the wheels are not broken,
nerve, flying beneath the melting stone of the cod.
Inherit only the gaze of the congregation, today, tomorrow,
remaining in the blue twilight of their coming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The effect continues at the water,
War is not for life, trenches, swords, bricks,
The left shore of the war is occupied by the Jews,
On the right wall, there's a bunch of faggots.
This battle goes on foot, never ends,
Recycled and worn for five hundred generations,
It's like a nuclear winter
'Cause a horse is attacking them from heaven,
And the darkness descends from under the earth,
Stretching the heel and crossing the knees.
Every one of us is standing on this or that.
Every one of us didn't put down our weapons right away.
Every one of us, while we're still alive,
Seeing where the councils are advising,
And the riders are auditioned and rehearsed,
Where you make yourself a poet.
Take me as a vido or a faggot,
I've been dreaming about this since third grade:
To make you a deer or a ram,
A dead chick or a fat girl,
A virgin in the bushes!
I sing with a sword in my chest and I'm not dying
The war that is taking place on the footsteps of paradise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The meeting is starting, everything is buzzing,
Witnesses are drawn and new witnesses brought,
The two-fifths are sentenced,
The defendant becomes a convicted felon.
The sentence is executed,
Usually it's the doctor and the prison chief.
Родственников сюда не пускают.
Journalists aren't allowed in here either.
This is where convicts are launched, one by one,
Figure out the shoulders, the ankles and the wrists,
Let's smoke one last time,
They give you a shot, they change the current,
The condemned becomes a bear.
Their relatives don't usually take them,
Although I do know one exceptional case:
They're holding it at the estate, guarded, in the forest to the edges.
The unreclaimed go to the zoo,
To the churches, to private living quarters:
Non-aggressive, well-trained,
On the back, "Mom" sometimes speaks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful, silent, that is Russian hardly two,
I like her surroundings, her cinnamon rolls and sugar and all that stuff,
All the blame and all the mischief is extinguished,
When she's in the corner and picks up the goods.
Her fingers take the deadbolts, her neck takes the cargo.
Green, scattered, sweet-licking greens,
The dark flesh of the butterfly is sinking into white.
The flesh of fine plastic; and the price is born.
And the harma is like a mother, and she does not look at it.
And ashamed of his public career.
I ask her a question, and she doesn't give me an answer.
I walk in like a thief, and she can't hold a burglar.
Poor her, her cheap labor.
She's all packed up and she can't stand the conversation.
Her and her common father will come to an end like a tide,
She'll hardly be innocent.
Her and her common father, the eldest tutor,
The head doctor of the empty hospital on the hill,
Somebody's ribs, like a needle, tightened.
And fear breeds a pair of eyelashes.
Her and the common father, he's coming for his daughter,
The dark road drags on day and night,
It's like a strip of fog at the back of the wagon.
When his armies reach the city
And will become a bone in the throat at the Red Square.
And to those who are in distress, they shall go forth in ways to quench their thirst;
Taking shorts in the roller coaster,
We'll wait for them at the bottom of the harbor,
Where Yul's manager yelled at her today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're allowed to smoke in the office,
They know it's a job to smoke,
Someone gets caught on the move: hey, commander,
The other from the table lifts his eyes to the door,
The second from the court raises his eye to the hook,
There's a lamp up and down, Svetlana, what can I say,
When the earth shakes and the soil swells,
And the arrested will nail themselves to the wall?
The third comes up, he has merits, and all of them are with him,
But they called, and he's coming.
"Wait for me at dawn," he says to his comrades,
Like he and they it's him and somebody else,
Who is alone like Job and waits for him like a storm.
What's the blue sign on his hand, Sister?
That's a strong sign on his hand, girl.
It says something like, "Friend,
My love, you, take care of yourself, don't take
Call your parents, take a day off on Wednesday,
Don't take it, try to be nice.
And call me if you need me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't wait till we get home, dear,
Not my friend, not me.
Reporting the situation:
There's only one war going on.
We're going to base camp.
At the bottom of the earth,
We're being hit by lightning,
But we left them.
And those who are here recently,
And those who, long ago,
They lie in the dark like dominoes
And listen to their own movies.
And between us the earth flows
Smells like wine.
We were human beings.
The white ear,
We are the smell of tears and sperm,
And roots and mud.
And I'm just a little bitch,
And burnt in the midst,
And the one who was with you at the window,
It consists of deep holes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last songs are being composed,
Invisible Front:
Out of the way,
Two or three lines running away from the fold,
To the rendezvous,
I'm staring at him.
And as they scattered,
You can't wash it in water!
How they dressed,
They can't speak Russian.
But with old, skilled hands
They're giving out bullets,
To the light with my ears
They're replacing the calashnikov,
They draw out from the wound,
Deep-set letters -
And by the morning, having passed the boundary,
They're entering a sleepless city.
They don't talk while they hear gunfire.
They don't talk while the music plays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's raining in Rotterdam.
Opening the umbrella, I raise the gate.
Four days they bombed the city,
and the city is gone.
not people hide in the alley
Streets, houses
They don't go crazy in these cases.
and falling, do not call for vengeance.
July afternoon.
The chorus of children's voices.
There are huge new buildings around.
Корбюзье имеет дело с Люфтваффе,
That you both worked so hard.
over Europe’s change.
What will be forgotten in the fury of the Cyclops,
Then the pencils will be completed in a straight line.
As the time is not devoted but to cultivation,
Without knowing how to distinguish between purpose and purpose,
And the stronger it is from the panacea.
Three decades later,
we drink wine in front of big summer stars
in the apartment on the 20th floor --
at the level reached already
The airplanes have not yet landed here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The northwest wind is blowing it up above
blue, red, purple, orange
A portion of Connecticut.

Farms, ham sandwiches.
In a fleeing air, alone,
All he sees is a multitude of beasts.
And the hills and the silver of the river,
♪ Like a hammer flapping like a живой arrow,
steel in the recesses of the passages,

New England. Falling to zero
Thermometers are like holes in the ground;
They're ashamed, running away from the fire.
And the leaves of the churches,
It's not a church.
The good works of the congregation,

And with the berries of the South,
To Rio Grande, to the Delta, into the crowd.

The grass whose blades are sharp,

The scent, the shadows
A brother or sister.
A heart full of flesh, a belly, feathers, wings,
blasting with a frequency of trembling,
He's got the knife in his hand,
By its own movable heat,
autumn blue, her own
Increasing by
A brown spot barely visible to the eye,
a point that slides above the vertices
They have eaten; on account of the emptyness in the face
The child who froze by the window,
the pair who came out of the car,
The woman on the porch.
But the rising stream lifts him up.

He sees that the horizon has fallen,
He sees like the thirteen first.
States, he sees:
There's smoke coming up from the pipes.
The pipes tells lonely
The bird as it rose up.
Where the fuck am I?
He feels mixed with anxiety
I'm proud.
The wing, it falls down, but the firm layer
The air brings it to the sky,
in the glittering ice.
The yellow eye becomes angry
I mean, a mixture of anger.
He's gone again.
But as a wall - a ball,
As the fall of a sinful man - again to faith,
It pushes him back.
He's still hot!
The goddamn thing is, it's higher up in the sky.
In an astronomically objective hell
Where there is no oxygen,
where, instead of ransom, there are crops from far away
What for two-legged eagles,
It's the opposite for the feathered.
Not a lump, but a lung bag.
He knows he can't escape.
And then he screams.

It's kind of scratchy.
Because it's warm up there.

In silver.
The bird swims in the zenith,
We can see it in binoculars from here.

We hear something upstairs,

The wind, the rainbow,

The map of Urals
The grass flying down the hill.
