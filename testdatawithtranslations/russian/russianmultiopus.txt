Don't leave the room, make no mistake.
Why do you need the sun if you smoke Shipka?
There's nothing meaningless behind the door, especially the sound of happiness.
Just go to the bathroom and come right back.
Oh, don't leave the room.
Because space is made out of a corridor.
and ends up with a counter.
You don't have to take off your clothes.
Don't leave the room; think you've lost your mind.
What's more interesting than a wall and a chair?
Why walk out of there when you're coming back tonight?
The same as you were, let alone mutilated?
Oh, don't leave the room.
In a coat on a bare body, in shoes on the bare foot.
The hallway smells of cabbage and ski ointment.
You wrote a lot of letters; one more will be superfluous.
Don't leave the room.
I wonder what you look like.
Ergo sum, as observed by the form in the hearts of the substance.
Outside, tea, not France.
Don't be a fool, be what others have not been.
Don't leave the room!
Shut up and barricade yourself.
Chronos, cosmos, eros, race, virus.

October is coming, the forest is shaking
The last leaves of its branches;
The autumn chill is gone and the road is freezing.
The whirlpool is still running behind the mill of the river,
But the pond is already frozen; my neighbor is rushing
To the wilderness with his hunting,
And they shall be in the midst of the lakes of mad amusement,
And the dogs' bark wakes the sleeping oaks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now it's my turn: I don't like spring;
I'm sick of the warmth; the smell, the dirt - in the spring I am sick;
Blood travels; feelings, minds are constrained by dullness.
In the harsh winter, I'm more content,
I love her snow; in the presence of the moon
Like an easy sleigh ride with a friend, fast and loose,
When it is warm and fresh,
She's shaking your hand, dusty and trembling!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How fun it is to wear iron-clad shoes,
Slip through the mirror of standing, even rivers!
And the winter holidays are the shining worries?
But you have to know the honor; six months of snow and snow,
For it is at last for the inhabitant of the valley,
Bear, it's boring.
Let's go sledding with the Younger Armies.
Or soak in the furnaces behind the double-glazed windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, red summer! I'd love you,
If it didn't burn, it'd be dust, mosquitoes, flies.
You, losing all your psychic abilities,
You have afflicted us, and we are like fields in the drought.
Just to get drunk, to freshen up,
There is no other thought in us, and it is a pity the winter of old age,
And having given her pancakes and wine,
Ice cream and ice cream make her happy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The days of the late autumn are fair,
But I like her, my dear reader.
The quiet beauty, glistening humbly.
Such an unloved child in his own family.
To tell you the truth,
Of all the seasons, she's the only one I'm happy with.
There is much good in it; the lover is not vain,
I found something in her with a dream of my own.
------------------------------------------
How do you explain that?
How do you possibly get a lazy virgin?
Condemned to death,
The poor thing bows with no rage, no anger.
There is a smile on the lips of the weary;
She heareth not the groaning of the grave;
It's still a purple color on his face.
She's alive today, not tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's disappointing time! Eyes are charming!
I'm glad you're a good-bye beauty.
I love the lush nature of decay,
And forests clothed in purple and gold,
In their shadows is the sound of the wind, and the breath of fresh air,
And the heavens are covered with clouds,
And the rarest ray of sunshine, and the first frosts,
And distant threats of the gray winter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And every autumn I bloom again;
The Russian cold is good for my health;
To the habits of existence I feel love again:
A dream comes to an end, and a hunger strikes;
Lightly and joyfully the blood plays in the heart,
My desires are boiling, I'm happy again, young,
I'm full of life again. That's my body.
(Let me forgive the unnecessary prose.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They bring a horse to me; in the open ditch,
And when he has gathered the horn, he carries the rider,
And it's ringing underneath his shiny skin.
The sound of a frozen valley and the cracking of ice.
But a short day goes by, and the quail is forgotten.
The fire burns again, and the bright light shines,
It's fading slowly, and I'm reading in front of it.
Or I feed long-suffering fools in my soul.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I forget the world and the sweet silence
I'm sweetly overwhelmed by my imagination,
And poetry awakens in me:
The soul is shy of lyrical excitement,
He trembleth and soundeth, and seeketh as in a dream,
To finally be freely manifested,
And there comes to me an invisible swarm of guests,
Long-time acquaintances, the fruits of my dream.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the thoughts in my head are stirring with boldness,
And the rhymes of the lungs run to meet them,
And fingers to pen, pen to paper,
A moment, and the verses will flow freely.
So the immovable ship lies dormant in the stillness,
But the sailors suddenly threw up, slipped
Up and down, and the sails are blown, the winds are full;
The tidal wave is moving and breaking up the waves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patiently, as a chestnut beats,
They wait patiently for death,
Patience, as the news ripens,
Patience, as vengeance lies -
I'll be waiting for you.
So the monarchy is waiting for the concubine)
Patiently, as rhymes await,
I can't wait to get my hands dirty.
I'll be waiting for you.
Teeth in the lips. Stalbnyak. Bullyzhnik).
Patiently, as Negu Peret,
Patience, like pearl.
The violin, the cello, and the harpsichord.
Doors: the roar of the rolling winds.
The highest rescript came:
- The change of kingdom and the entrance of the magnate.
And home:
In the non-terrestrial -
It's mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisters, gravity and tenderness are the same to you.
Honeysuckles and washes are heavy roses.
Man dies, the sand cools warm,
And yesterday's sun is on black stretchers.
Ah, heavy pitchers and soft nets,
It's easier to lift a stone than to repeat your name!
I have one concern left in the world:
The golden care, as time burden to be left.
Like dark water, I drink stale air.
The time was ploughed, and the rose was earth.
In the slow whirlpool heavy gentle roses,
Roses heavyness and tenderness in double wreaths splashed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only snakes shed their skins,
That the soul may grow old and grow.
We are not like serpents.
We change souls, not bodies.
Remember, you're a giant's hand
You lead your life like a horse's ass,
You're gonna tell me about the ones before.
They lived in this body before me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first: ugly and thin,
Loving only the shadow of the forests,
The leaf is dead, the child of sorcery,
In a word, a stopping rain.
The tree and the red dog -
This is the one he's made friends with,
Memory, memory, you don't get a sign,
You won't believe it was me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the second... he loved the south wind,
In every noise I heard the sound of lilies,
Said life was his friend,
The cradle under his feet is peace.
I don't like him at all, that's all.
He wanted to be a god and a king,
He hung a poster of a poet.
Over the doors to my silent home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love the man of freedom,
The runner and the shooter,
Oh, his water was ringing so loud.
And they envied the clouds.
His tent was high,
And the swords were sharp and mighty,
Like wine, he drank the sweet air
White of an unknown country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory, you're weaker year by year,
It's either that or someone else.
I've traded cheerful liberty
To the sacred long-awaited battle.
Knowing the pains of hunger and thirst,
An uneasy dream, an endless journey,
But St. George touched it twice.
I don't have a bruised chest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a sullen, stubborn architect.
A temple rising in the twinkling of an eye,
I was jealous of the Father's glory,
As in the heavens and the earth.
The heart will be a flaming flame
Until the day when they will rise up, clear,
The Walls of New Jerusalem
In the fields of my home country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then a strange wind blows -
And there will be a terrible light from the sky,
This Milky Way blossomed unexpectedly.
A garden of blinding planets.
He will appear before me, I do not know,
A traveler, hiding his face; but I will understand,
Seeing the lion chasing after him,
And the eagle flying towards him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll scream... but who's gonna help?
So my soul wouldn't die?
Only snakes shed their skins,
We change souls, not bodies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A body for the earth,
There's no reason to hide.
and hide it under a covering
leaves, snow, oblivion –
Don't be.
Every bird cries at dawn
For every one who lies with a white bone,
It's about beauty and vanity.
And she cries and she dances at dawn.
Why are you on your knees, my dear?
And you ask for charity like that.
They will burn you and scatter your dust.
No one will remember.
And the heart says to me:
"The fire from your shoulder remained
on my shoulder."
Sweet heart, scorching sunshine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm writing a letter to you, the one we talked about at midnight.
Years go by.
The nerves are stuck in the needle.
And no one will be returned.
You can shout all you want.
Let's have a look at the lamp.
You can squeeze your back against a dead tree.
and wait.
There's so much sky and air!
There's nothing to breathe.
The indoor rain has soaked everything -
and their feet are stuck to the ground,
Naked legs, thin thighs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're in the night.
on ghostly horses.
Nowhere, nowhere.
but weep and burn.
Squeezing the horses and seeing the scars,
and draw from the empty bottom.
Behind my back, there's nothing but losses.
- Around the ashes.
And our dead are everywhere
In the trees, in the holidays, the flowers.
Death doesn't let you wake up.
They have the same ashes on their mouths.
And when the light shines, wait, how hard it is,
When the night goes out of my sight.
And instead of the heart burns coal,
and it will melt instantly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe it's the fear of the leaves on an autumn day?
With empty eyelids David the victor feels space;
He forgot that he had become a stone a long time ago, and there was no place for him to run.
The cheese horizon, like a cut of potatoes under the blow of a shovel.
It's going to snow tomorrow, and it'll change our faces by stitching up the wrinkles.
The white goats of winter will trample through our garden, eating the bark of the apple tree,
and look into the windows, where we warm our hands over the silent fire of geraniums.
It's like days here, like drops in a solitary confinement.
And we are as immobile as David, two feet in the earth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A voice beating against blind windows, a voice trembling,
Into these walls, as if not accidentally loaded nails.
A voice from the throat, like a dove from a nest,
And they stumbled upon the deaf, and on the thunderbolts that whistle with their fingers.
Between them, between, in the snow-capped air,
As the flesh that knoweth the scalpel.
It's either warmer on the cheek, or just
The grains of the sky are melting and falling down like drops.
The voice is not caught, the wheels are not broken,
Nervous, flying under the moist stone of the vaults.
Followed by the gazes of the parishioners, today, tomorrow,
remaining in the blue dusk of their coming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The action continues near the water,
The war is not for life, trenches, swords, barracks,
The left bank of the war is occupied by the Jews,
On the right side of the wall there are paws.
This battle walks on foot, never ends,
And it shall overturn and consume five hundred generations,
Standing on its own, like a nuclear winter,
Because from heaven they are attacked by a horse,
And from beneath the earth cometh darkness,
Stabbing his heel and spreading out his knees.
Each of us stands on one or the other.
We didn't all put our weapons down at the same time.
Each of us, while still alive,
Looks to the place where the Qur'an is recited,
And the chariots shall hiss, and they shall cry aloud,
Where you become a poet involuntarily.
Take me for a jew or a faggot,
I've been dreaming about it since third grade:
Become for you a deer or a she-goat,
A victim's body or a fat aunt,
A virgin in the bushes!
I sing with my sword in my chest and I don't die
In a war on the brink of paradise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The meeting starts, it's buzzing,
The witnesses are withdrawn and new ones are introduced,
Two and five are condemned,
The defendant becomes a convicted felon.
The sentence is carried out,
Usually with a doctor and a prison warden.
Relatives aren't allowed here.
Journalists aren't allowed here either.
This is where the convicts are launched, one at a time,
Fixing shoulders, ankles and wrists,
Let's have a last-minute smoke,
They give the shot, they give alternating current,
The condemned becomes a bear.
Relatives don't usually take them,
Although I do know one exceptional case:
They've got a guard on the house. It's a forest to the brim.
The unwanted are scattered in zoos,
For circus groups, private living quarters:
Non-aggressive, well-trained,
They walk in the back, "Mom" sometimes say.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beautiful, silent, that is, in Russian barely two,
I like her surroundings, her spices, sugar and all the chalk,
¶ All the boastful boasts give glory,
When she's in the corner picking up the merchandise.
Her fingers are taken by the Pomeranians, her neck is a burden.
Green, withered, sweet-smelling pears,
She plunges the dark flesh of the eagle into the white.
The flesh of crystalline plastic; and the price is born.
And Hurmah is like a mother to her, and she doesn't look at her.
And he's ashamed of his public service.
I ask her a question, and she doesn't answer.
I walk in like a thief, and she can't stop the thieves.
Weakened by her, her cheap labour
It's all in her hands and she can't talk.
Her and her father-in-law will come down like a avalanche,
She's barely gonna be innocent.
Her and her father-in-law, the senior manager,
The chief physician of a hollow hospital,
Someone's ribs are stretched out like lies.
And fear breeds flattened eyelashes.
Her and her father-in-law, he's coming for his daughter,
He walks the dark path day and night,
Like a strip of mist at the wagon walls.
When his armies march into the city
And they shall be a bone in the throat at Red Square.
And the needy shall walk in the ways, famished by the famine,
Taking doughnuts off a roller coaster,
We'll wait for them at the bottom of the mound,
Where Julia's manager yelled at her today.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're still allowed to smoke in the office,
You know, it's a job, you gotta smoke,
One on the way catching up: hey, commander,
The other from the table raises his eyes to the door,
The second from the court raises his eyes to the hook,
There's a lamp here and there, Svetlana, I'll tell you,
When the earth is shaken, and the ground opens its mouth,
And the arrested will be stabbed in the wall?
The third gets up, he deserves it, and it's all up to him,
But they called, and he's coming.
"Wait for me at dawn," he says to his comrades,
It's like he and they're him and somebody else,
Who, like Job, waits for him like a storm.
What's that blue sign on his hand, Sister?
It's a strong mark on his hand, my friend.
It says something like, "My dear,
My beloved, you, guard yourself, do not take by all,
Call your parents, take Wednesday off,
If you don't, try to behave yourself.
And call me if you need me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't wait for us home, dear,
No friend, no me.
Reporting as follows:
One war at a time.
Based on the strawberry.
At the bottom of the earth,
Fireflies are beating on us,
But we got rid of them.
And those who are new here,
And those who have been long gone,
Lying in the dark like dominoes,
And they're listening to their movies.
And between us the earth flows
Thick as wine.
We were human.
The bee's ear,
We are the scent of tears and sperm,
And roots, and scum.
And I'm just a piece of shit,
Enchanted at the edges,
And the one standing by the window with you,
It consists of deep cavities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last songs are collected,
Fighters of the invisible front:
Coming out of nowhere,
Two or three lines running from capture,
Coming to the meeting place,
Looking bleak.
As they groaned,
No more water!
How they dressed,
They can't say it in Russian.
But with old, skilled hands
They're firing rounds,
To the light with eyes and ears
They're picking up "calashnikovs,"
Recovered from the wound,
Deep-seated letters -
And in the morning, when he had passed through the strongholds,
They're entering a sleepless city.
And silent as the guns go off.
And he's silent while the music plays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's raining in Rotterdam.
I'll open the umbrella and lift the gate.
For four days they bombed the city,
And the towns were destroyed, and the cities were desolate.
It's not like people are hiding in the driveway.
Streets, houses
They don't go crazy in these cases.
And when they fall, they call not for revenge.
It's the middle of July, dripping from the waffle.
A chorus of children's voices.
Huge new buildings all around.
Corbusier has something in common with Luftwaffe,
That they both worked hard from the bottom of their hearts.
Europe’s changing face.
That the Cyclops will forget in their fury,
Then the pencils will finish quietly.
As time is neither healing, but cultivating,
Seeing no means of distinction from the end,
And the stronger it is from the panacea.
Three decades later,
We drink wine by the big summer stars
in the apartment on the 20th floor --
at the level already achieved
They've been flying around here for a while.
