in a deserted mountain town
I saw rivers of air
that ran between clouds
and mountain peaks
carrying air fishes with air stones
air algae with 
drowned air men
one day I’ll climb out to the roof
of the tallest skyscraper
and, on an air raft, I’ll sail
to the end of the continent
where the sea of air begins
there’s an island on its edge —
you won’t know anything about it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s time to pack your bag and go.
You don’t know what to take – to carry;
something easy instantly found.
everything you’d possibly need,
Two or three brushes, soap and a towel.
Clean underwear, just in case your lover
meets you – or God. Either way,
you should have clean underwear.
A rose in a secluded place, among weeds
in dense, heavenly forest, will meet me
Like Blake’s symbol of delicate mysticism –
the rose who loves the worm.
Having allowed him into her alluring womb,
she trembles, hidden, to avoid me,
and all poetry – a shame, a bore,
oh, poor flower, lovely, dear . . .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the midst of a black night near a blue lake
a yellow tram stops and carries me
it doesn’t matter where—
I’ll hold the handrail
in order not to fall in this world
like an empty bottle
to the industrial zone
past the buildings I know but can’t see
past the poplars felled in the bygone century
past the sleeping people
past the three martens
who rustle here and there
and it all was already mine
all of it was already mine
only these fingers were not mine
only these white five
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little cloud swims to the sun,
With all her crimson borders trailing,
And beckons to the sun to sleep 
Cradled in the dark blue sea,
And covers it with rosy veiling,
As a mother lulls her child...
Lovely to the eyes... And now,
For one little hour of rest,
It seems, the heart is still,
With God speaks quietly...
Like an enemy, the mist 
Falls upon the sea 
And the little rosy cloud,
Darkness in its wake 
The grey mist rolls and billows out,
And the silent dark
Throws its shroud upon the soul,
And you don’t know where to wander,
Longing, longing for the light,
Like small children for their mother.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drowsy waves, sky unwashed and dirty,
And on the bank there out beyond,
As they were drunken... God of mercy!
The rushes sway without a wind
Is it still long I must endure,
Here, in this prison that holds sure 
Though lockless, by this worthless sea,
This weary life? It does not speak.
But silently, sways as if alive, 
The yellowed grass, across the plain.
To speak the truth is not its task...
And there is no one else to ask.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shall we ever meet again,
Or have we parted now forever,
Love's word, truth's word, 
to the deserts? Carrying to the empty plains
So be it! She was not our mother,
Yet we had to pay her honour!
Such is God’s will...Obey it surely,
Be humble, seek the Lord in prayer
Mindfully of one another;
Love your dear Ukraine, adore her,
Love her . . .  in fierce times of evil,
In the last dread hour of struggle,
Fervently beseech God for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why weighs the heart heavy? Why drags life so dreary? 
Why is the heart weeping and sobbing and wailing 
As a child cries from hunger? Heart, heavy and weary, 
What do you long for? Why are you ailing?
Are you longing for food or for drink or repose?
Slumber, my heart, for eternity sleeping,
Uncovered and shattered. . . . Let hateful people
Rage on. . . . O my heart, let your eyes gently close! . . .
