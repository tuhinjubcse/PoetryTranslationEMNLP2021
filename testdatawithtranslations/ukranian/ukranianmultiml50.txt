It's an abandoned city in the mountains.
I saw the air streams.
They're flowing through the clouds.
And it's the vertices.
They were carrying rocks and fish.
Air humidity and air pollution.
We're going to have to do a lot of diving.
One day, I'm going to climb onto the roof.
It's the tallest skyscraper in the world.
And in the flesh, I despair.
It ends at the end of the mainland.
And the air seas begin.
There's an island.
You don't know anything about it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's time to pack up and go.
Who knows what to wear — so that you can carry it around.
It wasn't that hard.
Everything you need right away.
Two or three brushes, a soap and a towel.
I'm going to clean it up so that at some point, it's clean.
It's a question of whether the lover will accept or whether God will.
in clean underwear for both.
It's the back of the throne in the clouds.
in the wilderness of paradise.
Like Blake, the mystic of darkness.
A thirteen-year-old who loves a worm.
I gave him a magic wand.
She shakes me and she hides me.
And all poetry is shame and boredom.
An unhappy flower, love, dear...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the middle of a black night on a blue lake.
The yellow train stops and carries me.
It doesn't matter where.
I'm going to hold my hand.
We're trying to make sure that we don't fall into this world.
It's like an empty bottle.
It's a very small area in the industrialized world.
I'm walking around buildings that I can't see, but I know.
We've seen poplars being cut down in the last century.
It's the people who are sleeping.
It's a three-legged animal.
There's a lot of noise going on here and there.
And all of this was already in my head.
It was all mine.
But those fingers weren't mine.
It's just these five white guys.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind the sun, the cloud is floating.
The red fields spread out.
And the sun is shining on the bunk.
It's in the blue sea.
It's made of rosemary.
I had to have a child.
You love it. One minute.
A little bit of an hour.
It's like the heart is open.
He's going to talk to God.
And the fog is like an enemy.
It covers the sea.
And the pink cloud.
And the darkness is over.
It spreads a blue mist.
And the dark, the silent.
It will fill your soul.
And you don't know where the kids are.
And you're looking for it in that world.
The mother's voice is the children.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the sky is still, and the waves are still.
And over the shore, it's barefoot.
It's like being drunk.
Without the wind, it rages. Oh, my God!
How long will it take me?
In societies, prisons are closed.
Over that useless sea.
Feed the world? It doesn't matter.
It speaks and it moves as if it were alive.
There's grass in the pile.
He doesn't want to tell the truth.
And nobody's going to ask any more questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are we going to meet again?
Have they gone away forever?
And the word truth and love.
It's spread in the hips and the thighs.
Don't worry about it. It's not our mother.
And they had to be respected.
That's the will of God. Come on!
Be humble. Pray to God.
And remember each other.
Love your Ukraine.
Love her... Because it's February.
The last really hard moment.
Pray for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's bothering me, what is boring me?
Whose heart is weeping, crying, screaming.
My child is hungry? My heart is heavy.
What do you want, what hurts?
Do you want to drink or eat or have sandwiches?
Dream, my heart, forever dream.
It's uncovered, broken.
Let the angry — shut up, heart, eyes.
