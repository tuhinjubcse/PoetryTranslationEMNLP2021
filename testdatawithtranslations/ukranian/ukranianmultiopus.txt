In a deserted city in the mountains
I've seen the air streams
They're floating through the clouds
and the vertices
Were carrying air rocks and air fish.
Airborne and surface-to-air missiles
ash trays
One day I'll climb on the roof
of the highest skyscraper
And I'll be stranded there on a raft
where the mainland ends
And the air sea begins
where there are islands,
You won't know anything about him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's time to pack up and go.
Who knows what to take - so as to carry
it wasn't hard, but still find
Anything you need at once.
Two or three brushes and a toothbrush.
I'll clean it up so that at some point,
when the jinn accepts, or God,
in a clean underwear for both of us.
♪ In the darkness, the shadow of the Trojan in the storm
In the heavenly womb, I will be feared.
Like Blake's image of a thin mystic,
A Trojan who loves a worm.
And We bestowed upon him a gracious favour.
And she will tremble and hide herself from me,
and all poetry is nothing but shame and boredom,
Poor flower, love, road...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the middle of a black night on a blue lake
The yellow tram stops and brings me
It doesn't matter where you go.
♪ I'll hold on to my hand
so as not to fall into this world
Like an empty bottle.
in the industrial zone
Through buildings I don't see but I know
After the topoles that were cut down in the last century.
To the people who talk.
on three legs
♪ Who's whispering in and out
And all that was already mine.
It was all mine!
Only those fingers weren't mine.
It's just these white fives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind the sun, the clouds float,
The red fields spread out
♪ And the sunshine of the night
In the blue sea: covers
With the pink peel,
You're the mother of a child.
It's nice to see you.
A little hour.
No heart is unbroken,
Talk to God...
And the mist, as if it were an enemy,
Covering the sea
And a little pink cloud,
# And the darkness behind you #
And the clouds of the Si'a'ib (Satan) spread forth, (saying): "O my Lord!
And in the darkness of the night
It fills your soul,
And you don't know where you're going.
And seek him of the world,
Mother of children.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the heavens are dim, and the waves are dull;
And beyond the banks of the river,
It's like a drunken, rowdy man.
Don't be angry without the wind.
I don't know how long I'm gonna live.
In an open-air prison,
Above the barren sea
Feed the world?
Speak and behave as if you were alive,
The grass that is sown in the stalk;
Doesn't want to tell the truth,
And no one else to ask.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do we ever get down again?
Have they gone away forever?
And the word of truth and love
They're spread in the steppes and the forests!
It's not our mother.
Had to be respected.
That's the will of God.
Be humble, pray to God.
And remember each other.
Love your homeland,
Love her... for time is cruel,
In the last moment of trouble
Praise the Lord for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I care about, what I need,
Whose heart weeps, howls, cries,
Is my child hungry?
What do you want that hurts?
Do you want to drink or eat or have a sandwich?
Wake up, my heart, wake up forever,
Unopened, broken, but the human being is unseen.
Keep your mouth shut, your heart and your eyes.
