in one abandoned city in the mountains
I saw the airy rivers
they flow between the clouds
and with its summits
carried balloon stones and fish
airy voracities and airily
ashtrays
one day I’ll climb up onto the roof
of the tallest skyscraper
and on a raft I’ll despair of going there
where the motherland ends
and the airy sea begins
where there are islands –
you won’t know anything about him
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s time to pack our bags and leave.
I don’t know what to take – so as to bear
it wasn’t difficult; but still to find
everything you need at once.
Two or three brushes, soap and a toothbrush.
Whiteness pure, so that at a certain moment,
when the lover accepts or God,
in the whiteness of cleanliness for both of us.
In oblivion, the throne of the storm-swept
will linger in heaven’s forest for me.
Like Blake’s image, mystic and thin,
a throan whom the little worm loves.
Having given him my magic bosom,
she trembles and she hides me,
and all poetry is just shame and boredom,
a wretched flower, love, road...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the middle of a black night on a blue lake
the yellow tram stops and carries me
no matter where –
I’ll hold on to my wing
so as not to get lost in this world
like an empty bottle
in the zone
past buildings I can’t see but know
beyond the poplars, cut down in the past century,
past people who are sleeping
behind three bushes
that rustle now and then
and all this was already mine
all this was already mine!
only these fingers were not mine
only these five white
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind the sun the skyscrapers float,
It spreads its red fields
And the sun of a sleeping bird
Into the blue sea: covers
With a rosy ashen glow,
My mother had a child.
Eyes are kind to you. A little girl,
A tiny hour
As if the heart were open wide,
To converse with God...
And the fog, unlike an enemy,
The sea is covered
And a pink skyscraper,
And the darkness behind
Blue mist spreads across the sky,
And in the silent darkness
Delights your soul,
And you don’t know where the children are,
And you await him, in this world,
My mother’s children.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the sky is silent, and the waves are drowsy;
And beyond the shore, a hut-hut,
As if drunk, he sketches
Without wind to rage. God Almighty!
How long will I live
In an unclosed prison of senses,
Above that pitiless sea
To be bored by the world? Doesn’t speak,
Moaning and shivering, as if alive,
The grass on the steppes is moistened;
She doesn’t want to tell the truth,
And no one else will be asked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shall we rise again
Have they gone away forever?
And the word of truth and love
Spread across the steppes and meadows!
Don’t let it be. It’s not our mother,
But had to be respected.
It’s the will of the Lord. Do it!
Be humble, pray to God
And remember one another.
Loving your Ukrainian land,
Love her... For in the ice-cold season,
In the last heavy minute
Please pray for her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is painful to me, what is boring,
Whose heart cries, laughs, screams out,
Is my child hungry? My heart is heavy,
What do you desire, what does it pain you?
Do you want to drink or eat or sleepwalk?
Sleep, my heart, forever sleep,
Undiscovered, broken, but people’s memories
Let it sink... Cover up, heart, eyes.
