I think of you
When the sun was shimmering
Shines upon the sea;
I think of you
When the shimmer of the moon
In springs paints.
I see you
When on the far road
The dust rises
In the deep night,
When on the narrow footbridge
The wanderer trembles.
I hear you
When there, with a dull roar,
The wave is rising.
In the quiet grove I often go to listen
When all is silent.
I am with you
Though thou be distant,
You are near me!
The sun is sinking,
Soon the stars will be shining for me.
Oh, there you would be!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
pools the city and in the park
over the paths where the summer is burnt
stand the sails of the smoke.
we'll sacrifice your chastity first, sweetest
and receive the gift of the tongue for it
exhausted and dissolved lie the bodies
in the shadow of the talk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh nourishment, fresh blood
From outer space I suck:
How is nature so good and generous
That holds me by my breast!
The wave is bending our boat
Upward at the wheel
And mountains in clouded skies
Began our course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye, my eye, where are you sinking?
Golden dreams, will you come again?
Gone, dream! thou art as gold:
Here, too, is love and life.
A thousand hovering stars are shining on the wave,
Soft mists drink the bullish distance;
Winds of the morn The shadowed bay,
And in the lake the ripening fruit reflects itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supplementary longing then takes place
When longing adds one more
what even the fulfillment, if it were there, lacked.
as at evening at the window in the mixed light
ties the unknown to the absolute
and the distance dissolves into space. i call:
I want nothing of what I already know!
otherwise there are cold loneliness
like the cold cocks in paris restaurants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the Crucified this frog lay
Rolled flat on the hot asphalt
The country road. Mouths wide open
Bow to the sun-tormented sky,
What resembled a shoe sole from afar –
An ancient earth-age amphibium
Came under the wheels in a leap.
No resurrection but in the larvae
Of flies that will hatch tomorrow.
Through which aperture does the dream escape?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feeling a sense of emptiness
Something is gnawing at your inside
Look around in dejection
How would you like to be someone else
Give yourself into our hands
We will transform you
without hesitating
Into their opposites
They trample
We dry them out
They are withered
We stimulate your juices
They insist on being a man
We alter your anatomy
They incline to meekness
We'll put you in a rage
They floated abroad
We invert your gaze
They doubt
We fill you with certainty
They Are Afraid
We hang you
on your teeth
beneath the circus dome
They rest within themselves
We'll tear you to pieces
They breathe health
We contaminate you
There should be within you
as a belated result
the desire to germinate
To be a man contradicting himself
we dialectically push you to the middle
The magicians and magnetisers of the house
are at one's disposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of the first light,
Picture of tenderness in sorrow!
mist swims with showers of silver
Around your charming face;
The soft tread of your feet
Wakes from daylit caverns
Sorrowful departed souls,
Awaken me and night birds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hardly in the wall, he was the middle,
fastened its radius
over the gardens, fields and furrows
the chicken stalls, the radies-
chenbed, became more extensive, mondial:
we hung the hatches up. we Hang a Strick-
jackets and frames, hanging raincoats
and screens up till we almost forgot him, whose hard look
will still be there when we've retired
and city and house and street
vanished – so undaunted far above,
so shining over east and west,
that you could navigate in the dark
after him, and old sailors a consolation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when October hung in the bough,
foul-mouthed lampions, it was time: we
picked quinces, bulged clumps of yellow into the kitchen
under the water. apple and pear ripen
to its name, a simple sweetness –
unlike the quitte at its tree in the farthest corner
of my alphabet, in the Latin of the garden,
hard and foreign in their arom. we cut,
quadruplicated, gutted the flesh (four large hands, two small),
surreptitiously in the steam of the juicer, gave
sugar, heat, toil becomes something that grows
got stuck in their mouths. who could, wanted to get a handle on quitting,
their jelly, in bulbous glasses for the
dark days on the shelves
in a cellar of days where they shone, glow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I sewn diamonds into your skirt so you can buy bread
I put the sleeper in the backpack with a jar of jam on top, but pfft
I rolled your undershirt under the sheet, you gotta unzip it quick
I stuffed the papers in this pocket downstairs so you know
I embroidered a little money in the cloak, maybe you can
I put Grandpa's watch in the vase by the window, they won't stop you
I put a pen in this envelope and I attached a letter to the uncle, give it to him
I severed the star from my jacket, so it's better
I burned the stars all, now every night is black
It seems that I have given all advice, but now I no longer have
I sewed diamonds into your skirt hem, but pfft
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am leaving this hut now
The abode of my dearest,
With veiled steps transform
Through the barren and murky woods:
Luna breaks through bush and oak,
Zephyr announces his run,
And the birches scatter with tilts
To you the sweetest incense.
How glad I am in the cooling
This beautiful summer night!
Oh how quiet it is to feel here
What makes the soul happy!
Can hardly grasp the bliss
And yet, O heavens, to thee
A thousand such nights to pass,
Give me one of my maidens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, it's the eyes again,
That once so dearly greeted me,
And it is the lips again,
That sweetened my life.
It is also the voice again,
That I once so dearly belonged to!
But it's not just I who've done it,
I have returned altered.
From the whitest, most beautiful arms
Locked tightly and lovingly,
I now lie upon her heart,
Are dull to the senses and enraged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star is falling down
From its sparkling heights
That is the star of love
I see falling there.
Falling from the apple tree,
Of white leaves so much,
Come the necking breezes,
And play their game with it.
The swan sings in the pond,
And roars up and down,
And ever softer singing,
He dives into the river's grave.
It is so still and dark
Now blown are leaf and flower,
The star has crunched and shattered,
Transfixed the song of the swan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweep from every branch
Wandering birds aloft,
Far into the air
You can hear the travel choir
To south, to south
In the eternal flowering.
Your little bird sings cheerfully down,
We sing merrily outside
When Spring comes,
Let us return again,
Again in nest and in house,
From the South! Now forth!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaded by blossoming boughs,
Cooled by the playful West,
Here lay Rosilis by the stream
And Hylas beside her.
They sang each other funny songs,
She flung flowers at him and he;
She neckled him, he necked her,
Who knows how long and how.
Touched by Spring and by Love,
Was persuaded to kiss Hylas.
He kissed them, he squeezed them
That she cried for help.
The mother came with haste and asked,
What foul deeds did Hylas dare here?
The daughter cried, "It has happened,
You may henceforth go.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laziness, at last I must ask
Sing a little song of praise. –
Oh, how sour it will be to me,
Singing of Yourself for dignity!
Yet, I will do my best
After work it is good to rest.
Highest good! whoever has thee
Whose undisturbed life
Ah! I yawn I grow weary
So thou may'st forgive me
That I cannot sing you;
You prevent me from doing so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At midnight I went, not exactly fondly,
Little boy, to that graveyard
To the parson's house; star upon star,
They all shone all too fair;
At midnight.
When, beyond the bounds of my life,
To the lover must have, must, because she was fleeing,
Starling and northern light upon me in strife,
I go, I come, soak blissfulness;
At midnight.
Till, at last, the full bright moon
So clearly and distinctly urged me into the dark,
Even the willing, persistent, quickest
About the past and the future like a snake;
At midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the doors will I sneak,
I will stand still and moral;
Hands of piety will come to feed,
And I shall go on.
Everyone shall seem happy
When my image appears before him;
He will weep a tear
And I know not what it weeps.
---------------------------------------------------------- To whom God wills to show favour
He sends it into the wide world,
To him will he show his wonders
In mountain and wood, and stream and field.
The tears that lie at home,
Does not revive the dawn,
All they know is the weighing of children,
Of sorrows, burdens, and need for bread.
The streamlets leap from the mountains,
The larks whirl high in desire,
Why should I not sing with them
From the throat full and the chest fresh.
I'll let the Lord Almighty prevail;
The little stream, lark, wind and field,
And keep the earth and the heaven,
My deeds, too, were in order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home beyond the lightning red
Here come the clouds
But father and mother are long dead,
No one there knows me any more.
How soon, oh how soon the silent time will come,
There do I rest, and above me
The woodland's loneliness rustles,
And no one here knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your image wondrously
Within the depths of my heart
Seems so fresh and cheerful
Reaching out to me at every hour.
My heart still sings within itself
An old and lovely song,
That swings into the air
And hasten toward thee.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is late already, it is cold already
Why dost thou ride through the wood alone?
The wood is long, you are alone,
O thou fair bride! I lead thee home!
"Man's craft and deceit are great,
My heart is broken with pain,
Perhaps the wood horn flies here and there,
Oh flee! thou know not who I am.”
So richly adorned are the horses and wives
So beautiful the young body,
Now I know thee—God be with me!
You are the Witch Lorelei
"You know me well—of high stone
My castle still looks down on the Rhine.
It is late already, it is cold already
You must never leave this wood."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is none to know or to advise,
How good it is to me, how good!
If Only One — only One knew —
That no one else should know!
Nowhere is it so still in the snow,
So mute and silent are
The stars not in the heavens
Than my thoughts are.
I wish I were a little bird
And float across the sea,
Well over the sea and beyond,
Until I am in heaven!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens were
The earth silently kissed,
That in the shimmer of blossom
All you have to do is dream.
The air went through the fields,
The ears weighed gently
The woods murmured softly,
So clear as stars was the night.
And my soul longed
Far their wings are spread,
Flew across the silent lands,
As if flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tree-tops rustle and shudder,
As if to that hour
Around the half-sunken walls
The ancient gods all around.
Here behind the myrtle trees
In secret gloomy splendour,
As in dreams, what are you saying,
To me, fantastic night?
Upon me all the stars are twinkling
With a burning look of love,
The distance talks drunkenly
As of great future happiness!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallen asleep on the Lauer
Up above is the old knight;
Overcast are the showers,
And the wood rustles through the lattice.
With beard and hair all grown in,
And petrified breast and antlers,
He has sat for many a hundred years
Up in the silent glade.
Outside it is quiet and peaceful,
All have gone down into the valley,
Birds of the wood singing lonely
Into the empty arches of windows.
A wedding drives down
Upon the Rhine in the sunshine,
Musicians play cheerfully,
And the beautiful bride who weeps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hear the brooks rustle
In the woods to and fro,
In the woods, in the rustle
I don't know where I am.
The nighting-birds beat
Here in the solitude,
As if they wanted to say something
Of the old, pleasant time.
The moonlight flies,
As if I saw beneath me
The castle lies in the valley,
And yet is so far from here!
As if one day in the garden
Full of roses white and red,
My darling, waiting for me,
And yet has long been dead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may sing at times
As if I were happy
But secretly, tears invade
My heart then becomes free.
Nightingales make it
Spring air plays outside
To sound the longing song
From the grave in her dungeon.
There all hearts listen
And all is glad
But none feels the pains
In song, the deepest sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Twilight spreads its wings
Trees shudder and stir,
Clouds drift like heavy dreams—
What does this grass mean
Dearest thou one deer to another,
Let it not graze alone,
Hunters roam the woods and blow,
Now and then voices wander.
Do you have a friend here below,
Do not dare at this hour
Kindly with eyes and mouths,
He makes war in treacherous peace.
What to-day wearily undergoes
Will rise anew tomorrow.
Some things are lost in the night—
Beware, be awake and cheerful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a wedding along the mountain,
I heard the birds beating,
A host of riders flashed, the wood horn rang,
That was a jolly hunt!
And ere I thought it all was hushed away,
The night covers all around;
Only the mountains are rustling in the woods
And it frightens me deep down in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Across the garden through the breeze
I heard migrating birds
That means the scent of spring,
Beneath, it is beginning to bloom.
I'd like to swallow but would rather weep
To me it is as though it could not be!
Old wonders shine again
With the gleam of the moon.
And the moon, as the stars say,
And in dreams the grove rustles
And the nightingales beat it:
It is yours, it is thine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the woods were sleeping,
He started digging
Restless in mountain's depths
For a treasure he dug.
The Angels of God sang
While in the still night
As if red eyes were pressing
metals from the shaft.
'And thou shalt be mine!' and grimmer
Hurl it and hurry down!
There fall stones and ruins
Descending over the fools.
Laughing wildly
From the decayed grave,
The angel's call died
Blissful in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two chaps of warrior caliber
From home for the first time,
So rejoicing right into the bright,
Ringing, singing waves
Out of the brimful spring.
Those striving for lofty things,
Who, in spite of pleasure and pain,
Fulfilling what's right in the world,
And to whom they passed
To the laughing mind and heart.
The first to find a darling
The Sweepers bought the Manor and House;
He soon weighed a littleübchen,
And saw from a secret spot
And out into the field.
To the second lied and sang
The thousand voices in the ground,
Alluring sirens, and drew
Into the bubbling waves
In the billowing coloured throat.
And how he appeared from the sleeve,
There he was tired and old,
His little ship that lay at bottom
So still it was all around,
And over the water it is cold.
The waves ring and sing
Of spring be upon me;
And I see so bold a fellow,
The tears in my eyes are swelling—
Oh, God, lead us fondly to Thee!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, solace of the world, silent night!
How gently from the mountains do you rise,
The breezes all sleep,
A wandering seafarer's tiredness,
Sings across the sea his eventide
To God's praise in the harbor.
The years like the clouds go
And leave me here alone
The world has forgotten me,
Then you came to me in a wondrous way,
When I, at the roar of the woods,
Sitting in thoughtfulness.
O solace of the world, silent night!
The day has made me so tired,
Already, the wide sea is darkening,
Let me rest from need and from desire,
Till the eternal dawn
Sparkling through the silent woods.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home beyond the lightning red
Here come the clouds
But father and mother are long dead,
No one there knows me any more.
How soon, oh how soon the silent time will come,
There do I rest, and above me
The woodland's loneliness rustles,
And no one here knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens were
The earth silently kissed,
That in the shimmer of blossom
All you have to do is dream.
The air went through the fields,
The ears weighed gently
The woods murmured softly,
So clear as stars was the night.
And my soul longed
Far their wings are spread,
Flew across the silent lands,
As if flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the sun were shining sweetly
As in Christendom blue and lukewarm,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shining meadows.
In the night the darling listened
At the window expecting sweetly,
Wish me and you, the two of us,
Secretly a beautiful night.
If the sun were shining sweetly
As in Christendom blue and lukewarm,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shining meadows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bright day has passed
From afar comes the peal of bells;
Thus does time travel through the night,
Takes some with it who have not thought.
Where now is the colourful desire
The friend's comfort and the faithful breast,
The sweetest glimpse of the lover?
Won't anybody want to commune with me?
Fresh then, dear nightingale,
You waterfall with bright sound!
Let us praise God together,
Till the bright morning shines!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She must have stood at the window
And, sadly, her hair curled up
The hunter had gone,
The hunter was her lover.
And when the spring came,
The world was covered with blossoms,
Then she took a heart away
And went into the green meadows.
She puts her ear to the lawn
Hear the sound of hooves far off –
These are the deer grazing
On the shadowy mountain slope.
And in the evening the woods rustle,
Just a shot from afar will fall,
She stands and listens in silence:
'That was the greeting of my dearest!'
And springs sprang up from the rock,
Then the little birds fled into the valley.
"And where ye meet him, ye fellows,
Oh, greet him a thousand times!”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above silent heights
Standing in the woods was a house;
So lonely it was to be seen
Beyond the woods beyond.
A girl sat inside
In the still of evening,
Wear silk threads
To her wedding gown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and see
In field and forest and valley,
Down the mountain into the meadow;
Hail thee, fair and high wife,
I greet thee a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Many flowers, fair and fine,
Many crowns I'll winge from it
And a thousand thoughts I bind
And greetings within.
None may I give to her
It is too high and fair
They all must fade,
Only love of a kind
Forever abides in my heart.
I seem to be much happier
And lift up and lift down,
And, if the heart should burst,
I dig away and sing,
And make my grave straight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soft rustling in the tree-tops,
Flying so far away, little birds,
Bronze from its silent summits,
Tell me where my home lies.
Today in dreams I saw her again,
And from all the mountains departed
Such a salutation to me
That I began to weep.
Ah! here on the foreign summits:
People, fountains, rocks and trees-
All is like a dream to me!
Mournful birds in the tree-tops,
Your companions down the valley,
Greets me from foreign summits
A thousand times my homeland!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and see
In field and forest and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
Up from the mountain far into the blue:
I greeted thee a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Many beautiful and delicate flowers;
I'll soon be wreathed with garlands,
And a thousand thoughts I bind
And greetings within.
None may I give to thee
You are too high and fair
They must vanish too soon
Love like no other
Forever abides in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I'd lie in the woods,
In the woods it murmurs so softly,
With her starry mantle
There, the night covers me,
Then come the little streams gone,
Am I asleep already?
I sleep not, I hear long yet
To the nightingales
When the treetops sway above me
It’s ringing all through the night,
These are the thoughts in the heart,
That sing when no one is awake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read deep in you
Don't you dare to tell me
What an enchanted being
Speaks from your voice!
So many words invade
To our ears without a plan
And as they fade
All has been drained!
But even from afar
Thy voice reaching to me
I so gladly listen to it,
I forget him so badly.
I tremble then, entglimme
Of all-pursuant embers:
My heart and your voice
To know each other too well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I snatch myself up in the night, at night
And felt myself drawn away,
I left the lanes guarded by the watchman,
Gently walked through
At night, at night
The gate with the Gothic arch.
The Mühlbach murmured through rocky shafts,
I leaned over the bridge
Deep beneath me I heeded the waves
That fluttered so gently
At night, at night
But there was not a backward glance.
Upward it whirled, boundless in flame
Melodious change of stars,
With them the moon in calmed splendour,
They twinkled gently
At night, at night
Through the deceptively remote distance.
I looked up in the night, at night
And looked down again;
O woe, how have you spent the days,
Now silent be gentle,
At night, at night
Repentance in a throbbing heart!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I creep about
Sorrowful and mute,
You ask, oh ask
Not Me, and why?
The heart is shaken
So many pains!
And could I ever
Too gloomy?
The tree withered,
The scent fades
The leaves lie
So yellow in the bed,
There's a tempestuous shower
With might come in,
And could I ever
Too gloomy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stream that rustled beside me, where is it now?
The bird whose song I listened to, where is it now?
Where is the rose that the girl-friend wore on her heart,
And that kiss that intoxicated me, where is it now?
And that man that was I, and that I had long since
With another I exchanged, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say I was deceiving myself,
Swear it high and holy,
I do know that you loved
But thou lovest no more!
Your fair eye burned,
The kisses burned so badly
You loved me, do you admit,
But thou lovest no more!
I count not again
Faithful return;
Show only that you loved
And do not love me any more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has lied,
My sorrow weighs heavily,
Betrayed, oh, betrayed
It's all about me!
Clear drops are pouring
Always lowering her cheek,
Turn off, turn off the bapping,
Leave it, my heart, leave it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is broken, you do not love me!
You let me know that you do not love me!
Yet to you I appeared pleading and encouraging,
And caress love, thou lovest me not!
You spoke it, you said it in words,
Knowing full well, thou lovest me not!
So shall I call the stars and the moon
Missing the sun? you don't love me!
What is the rose blooming, the jasmine,
What are the daffodils blooming? you don't love me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eye is dim, my mouth is mute,
Thou bid'st me speak, that it be thus!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is red,
And what you wish is a commandment.
My hair is grey, my heart is sore,
You are so young and so healthy!
You want to talk me into it and make it hard for me.
I look at thee and I tremble so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I've seen it
I think I am blind;
Wherever I gaze
I see him alone;
As in a dream awake
His image floats before me
Floats from the deepest darkness,
Brighter only upwards.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me
After the sisters' games
I no longer desire
I would rather weep
Silently in the closet;
Since I've seen it
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so good, how so mild!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright mind and firm courage.
As there in the blue deep,
Bright and splendid, that star,
So here he is in my sky,
Bright and splendid, holy and far.
Wander, wandering your ways;
Just look at thy shining
Just look at him humbly,
Just be blissful and sad!
Hear not my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to your happiness;
Darest thou not to know me, poor maid,
High star of glory!
Only the most virtuous of all
May your choice be blessed,
And I will bless the high,
Many, many thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and weep
Blessed then, blessed am I;
Even if my heart were to break,
Break, oh heart, what is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot fathom, cannot believe
A dream has taken hold of me;
How would he be among all
Exalts and delights my arms?
It was to me that he spoke:
"I am thine for ever"—
It was—I dream still,
That can never be the case.
O let me die in dreams
Weighing on his breast,
The blissful death to sip me
In tears of endless delight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ring at my finger,
My golden garter rabbit,
I press you piously to my lips,
To my heart devote thyself.
I had dreamt him out
The peaceful dream of childhood,
I found myself alone, lost
In the barren, infinite space.
Ring at my finger
That's when you taught me first
You have opened your eyes to me
Of life's infinite and profound worth.
I will serve him and live for him,
Wholly belong to Him,
To give myself and find
Transfigure me in its splendour.
Ring at my finger,
My golden garter rabbit,
I press you piously to my lips,
To my heart devote thyself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Attire me kindly,
The fortunate man today serves me
Winds busily
Around my brow
Nor of the blooming myrtle ornaments.
When I am satisfied
Of a cheerful heart,
Unless it lay in the beloved's embrace
Still he cried,
Longing in the heart,
Impatient of the present day.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me evaporate
A foolish trepidation
That I with clear
Eye him greet,
Him, the source of joyfulness.
You are, my beloved,
You appeared to me
Didst thou, sun, give thy light to me?
Let me in worship
Let me in humility,
Let me bow to my lord.
scatter it, sisters,
Scatter flowers for him,
Bring him bouquets of ripened roses,
But to you, sisters,
I greet with melancholy
Departing happily from your ranks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, thou behold'st
Marvels at me
You can't fathom it
How I can weep;
Leave the damp pearls
Unwonted splendour
Trembling gaily bright
In my eye!
How frightened my breast is,
How so blissful!
If only I knew in words
As I shall say;
Come and bird thy countenance
Here upon my breast,
Will whisper in your ear
All my desire.
Will you now whiten the tears
That I can weep for
Won't you see them
You beloved man?
Stay with my heart,
Feel its beating
That I firmly and firmer
May press only on you.
Here at my bedside
The cradle has room
Where silently hide
My fairy dream;
The morning will come,
Where the dream awakens,
And from it your image
Laugh at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
My bliss, my desire!
Happiness is love, and love is happiness,
I have said it and do not take it back.
With infinite appreciation
But now I am exceedingly happy.
Only she there nurtures, only she here loves,
The child she gave  nourishment to;
Only one mother on her own knows
What it means to love and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man
Cannot feel the bliss of motherhood!
Dearest, angel, you
You look at me and smile along the way!
On my heart, on my breast,
My bliss, my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have done me my first pain,
But he who struck.
Thou slumberest, thou harden'd, merciless man,
The sleep of death.
The trusting one looks ahead,
The world is empty.
I loved and I have lived, I am
No longer alive.
I withdraw into my innermost being,
The veil falls,
There, I have you and my lost happiness,
Thou my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the myrtle adorned and the bridal fleet,
The jailer's daughter, the rosy maid
Step into the lion's cage; he lies
To the mistress at whose feet he nestles.
The mightiest, wild and reckless before,
Look up to your mistress piously and sensibly;
The maid, tender and full of bliss,
Caress him gently and at the same time weep:
"How were in days that are no more,
Even faithful playmates, like children and children,
And loved us and liked us;
The days of childhood lie far away.
"Earlier we believed that thou might'dst shake,
Thy moan-swept royal head;
I grew up, you see: I am
The child no longer with childish sense.
“Oh, if I were still the child and stayed with you,
My strong, faithful, honest beast;
But I must follow, they did it to me,
Out into the foreign land of the stranger.
"He thought I was fair,
I was set free, now it is over:
The wreath upon my hair, my friend,
And no more bright for tears' eyes.
‘Do you understand me quite? Look at me grimly
I am caught, so be calm, you too;
There I see him come, whom I must follow,
So, my friend, may I give thee my last kiss!"
And how the maiden's lips touched him
There, one felt the kennel trembling,
And, gazing at the youth in the kennel,
Terror grasps the frightened bride.
He stands at the door of the kennel on the watch,
He swings his tail, he roars with might;
Beggaring, pleading, and threatening
Out; he blocks the exit in anger.
Outside, a lonely scream is heard.
The youth cries, "Bring arms here;
I'll shoot him if I can find a way!"
The angered roar up shyly in rage.
The unfortunate woman dares to go to the door,
Then he comes upon the mistress transformed:
The beautiful form, a ghastly prey,
Lies bloodied and disfigured in the dust.
And how he shed the precious blood,
He lays himself on the corpse with sinister courage,
He lies so drowned in sorrow and pain,
Until the fatal bullet hits the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky arches purple and blue,
The frost exhibits flowers.
A shimmering veil hangs at the window.
A youth stands there looking at him.
And beyond the flowers blooms
A pair of blue and smiling eyes.
Violets of March, like this one, still unseen.
The frost will crumble when breathed in.
Ice-flowers begin to melt
And God be merciful to the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mother begs heartily and looks
Delighted in the slumbering little ones.
He rests in the cradle so gently and sadly.
He must be an angel to her.
She kisses him and hugs him, hardly holding on.
Forgetting earthly pains,
Its dream of hope sweeps into the future.
Thus dream mothers within their hearts.
The raven yet with the sorcery
Round the window outside is the sage:
Thy angel, thy angel shall be ours!
The robber feeds upon us!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It goes with the muffled drum sound;
How far the place is! how long the way!
Oh, that he were at rest and all was over!
I think my heart is breaking in two.
I loved him the only one in the world,
Only him, to whom now death nonetheless doth reign.
We parade as we play,
I too am in command.
He looks on for the last time
In God's sunshine of delight,—
Now they close his eyes—
May the Almighty grant you eternal rest!
Nine may well have laid it down then,
Eight bullets have swept past;
They all tremble with grief and pain—
I, however, found him right in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the small town there is much to rejoice in,
There they hold their wedding feast with dance and game,
The cheerful ones see the red of the wine
The bride resembleth attenuated death.
Yes, dead to him she does not forget,
Who is not the bridegroom at the feast;
There he stands among the guests in the jug,
And stroke the fiddle merrily enough!
He strokes the violin, his hair is gray,
The strings are swinging yellow and loud,
He presses it to his heart and pays no heed
If it too breaks into a thousand pieces.
It is cruel indeed to die thus,
When young is the heart that strives for joy;
I like it and no longer want to see it!
That would dizzily twist my head.—
Who shall tell you to point your fingers at me?
Oh God — mercy be with us —
That none can be conquered by madness;
I'm a poor musician myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I've seen it
I think I am blind;
Wherever I gaze
I see him alone;
As in a dream awake
His image floats before me
Floats from the deepest darkness,
Brighter only upwards.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me
After the sisters' games
I no longer desire
I would rather weep
Silently in the closet;
Since I've seen it
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so good, how so mild!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright mind and firm courage.
As there in the blue deep,
Bright and splendid, that star,
So here he is in my sky,
Bright and splendid, holy and far.
Wander, wandering your ways;
Just look at thy shining
Just look at him humbly,
Just be blissful and sad!
Hear not my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to your happiness;
Darest thou not to know me, poor maid,
High star of glory!
Only the most virtuous of all
May your choice be blessed,
And I will bless the high,
Many, many thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and weep
Blessed then, blessed am I;
Even if my heart were to break,
Break, oh heart, what is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot fathom, cannot believe
A dream has taken hold of me;
How would he be among all
Exalts and delights my arms?
It was to me that he spoke:
"I am thine for ever"—
It was—I dream still,
That can never be the case.
O let me die in dreams
Weighing on his breast,
The blissful death to sip me
In tears of endless delight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ring at my finger,
My golden garter rabbit,
I press you piously to my lips,
To my heart devote thyself.
I had dreamt him out
The peaceful dream of childhood,
I found myself alone, lost
In the barren, infinite space.
Ring at my finger
That's when you taught me first
You have opened your eyes to me
Of life's infinite and profound worth.
I will serve him and live for him,
Wholly belong to Him,
To give myself and find
Transfigure me in its splendour.
Ring at my finger,
My golden garter rabbit,
I press you piously to my lips,
To my heart devote thyself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Attire me kindly,
The fortunate man today serves me
Winds busily
Around my brow
Nor of the blooming myrtle ornaments.
When I am satisfied
Of a cheerful heart,
Unless it lay in the beloved's embrace
Still he cried,
Longing in the heart,
Impatient of the present day.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me evaporate
A foolish trepidation
That I with clear
Eye him greet,
Him, the source of joyfulness.
You are, my beloved,
You appeared to me
Didst thou, sun, give thy light to me?
Let me in worship
Let me in humility,
Let me bow to my lord.
scatter it, sisters,
Scatter flowers for him,
Bring him bouquets of ripened roses,
But to you, sisters,
I greet with melancholy
Departing happily from your ranks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, thou behold'st
Marvels at me
You can't fathom it
How I can weep;
Leave the damp pearls
Unwonted splendour
Trembling gaily bright
In my eye!
How frightened my breast is,
How so blissful!
If only I knew in words
As I shall say;
Come and bird thy countenance
Here upon my breast,
Will whisper in your ear
All my desire.
Will you now whiten the tears
That I can weep for
Won't you see them
You beloved man?
Stay with my heart,
Feel its beating
That I firmly and firmer
May press only on you.
Here at my bedside
The cradle has room
Where silently hide
My fairy dream;
The morning will come,
Where the dream awakens,
And from it your image
Laugh at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
My bliss, my desire!
Happiness is love, and love is happiness,
I have said it and do not take it back.
With infinite appreciation
But now I am exceedingly happy.
Only she there nurtures, only she here loves,
The child she gave  nourishment to;
Only one mother on her own knows
What it means to love and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man
Cannot feel the bliss of motherhood!
Dearest, angel, you
You look at me and smile along the way!
On my heart, on my breast,
My bliss, my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have done me my first pain,
But he who struck.
Thou slumberest, thou harden'd, merciless man,
The sleep of death.
The trusting one looks ahead,
The world is empty.
I loved and I have lived, I am
No longer alive.
I withdraw into my innermost being,
The veil falls,
There, I have you and my lost happiness,
Thou my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream of my own days,
Who are now far away,
Daughter of my daughter,
You, my sweet child,
Take, before the weariness
Covers the shroud
Take to fresh life
My benediction.
See me grey with hair,
Abandoned and pale.
I, like you, have been
Young and blissful
Love me the way you love me,
Were like you a bride,
And you too will grow old
Just as I greyed out.
Let time fly by
Moving on and on,
Just be constant and true
The horns of your bust;
I told you so long ago,
I will not take it back:
Happiness is only in love,
Love is bliss alone.
Than the one I loved
Into the grave laid,
Have I given my love
Loyally carried within me:
My heart was broken,
I still had the courage
And the ashes of old
Holds out the holy embers.
Take, before the weariness
Covers the shroud
Take to fresh life
My benediction:
You must have a heart to beat,
Stay firm your courage,
Be the pain of love
Then your highest good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At night we would kiss, oh girls,
No one looked at us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We have been faithful to the stars.
A star has fallen
He sued the sea,
The sea has got it under control,
The helm to the shipowner told.
Then sang the same old sailor
Before the eyes of his lovers.
Now it sings on the streets and markets
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many times have I been among the lovers
Resting in fragrant grass,
And sung me a little song
And all was fair and good.
Loneliness afflicted me as well
And had no sense or courage
But I came to sing again
All was well once more.
And some of what I learn,
I pounced in silent woe,
But I came to sing again,
All was well once more.
You shall not long complain,
Whatever hurts you
Only fresh, only freshly sung!
And everything will be all right again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may have wandered out at a mournful hour,
Love wept so much,
My feet are numb, my shoulders ache,
My heart is weighing so heavily.
What do you sing, birds, in the morning light?
You do not know how to part!
Sorrows and shoes do not press you;
Ye birds, ye have it well!
