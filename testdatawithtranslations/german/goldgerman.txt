I think of you,
when I see the sun’s shimmer
Gleaming from the sea.
I think of you,
when the moon’s glimmer
Is reflected in the springs.
I see you,
when on the distant road
The dust rises,
In deep night,
when on the narrow bridge
The traveler trembles.
I hear you,
when with a dull roar
The wave surges.
In the quiet grove I often go to listen
When all is silent.
I am with you,
however far away you may be,
You are next to me!
The sun is setting,
soon the stars will shine upon me.
Would you be there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
bundles the city and in the park
above the paths where summer’s burned
stand sails of smoke.
we’ll sacrifice your chastity first, dearest
and get the gift of language in return
spent and relaxed the bodies lie
in the shade of speech
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I draw in fresh sustenance,
New blood from the untrammeled world:
How gracious and generous is nature,
Who holds me to her bosom!
The wave sways our boat
To the rhythm of the oars,
And mountains, nebulously reaching for heaven,
Meet our course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye of mine, why are you downcast?
Golden dreams, have you returned?
Away dream, golden though you are:
Here, too, there are love and life.
A thousand hovering stars twinkle on the wave,
Soft mists drink the towering horizon around us,
The morning breeze flutters over the shaded bay,
And the lake reflects the ripening fruit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supplementary desire takes place when
ever desire itself adds that which
even fulfilment, if it existed, would lack.
in the mingling light at evening windows
when the unknown meshes with the absolute
and distance dissolves into expanse. i shout:
i want none of what i already know!
otherwise there’s cold solitudes
like there’s cold chicken in paris restaurants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cruciform frog Lay 
flattened against the hot macadam
Of the country lane. Mouth gaping
It curled heavenwards, dried out by the sun,
The sole of a shoe, as first appeared –
An amphibious holdout from an older era
Now caught under the wheels.
No resurrection, save in the form of the larvae
Of the flies that will hatch from it tomorrow.
The dream leaks out of which orifice?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You feel an inner void
Something is gnawing at your soul
Enviously you scrutinize others
longing to be who you are not
Do not despair
we shall transform you
Proudly
in your opposite
If you drip
we shall staunch the flow
If you feel barren
we shall get your juices going
If you insist on being a man
we’ll alter your anatomy
If you feel gentle
we’ll drive you raving mad
If you squint the wrong way
we’ll invert your gaze
If you are consumed with doubt
we’ll inject conviction
If you suffer from anxiety
we’ll hang you
by your teeth
beneath the circus dome
If you are emotionally balanced
we’ll tear you apart
If you exude good health
we’ll contaminate you
Should you
as an after-effect
be gripped by the desire
to prevail amid contradictions
we’ll shift you dialectically into the middle
Our magicians and magnetists
await your call
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of Creation's light,
Image of tenderness in sorrow,
Silver mists your radiance borrow
As they swim across your sight.
At your footfall through the sky
In their dusky hollows waken
Souls that sadly died forsaken,
Birds that shun the day, and I.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scarcely in the wall, he was the center,
expanding its radius 
across the gardens, fields, beet briar 
and further, to the henhouses, the radish- 
patch, becoming more worldy, all-encompassing:
we hung up the hats. we hung up cardigans
and picture frames, hung coats, umbrellas,
until we almost forgot him, whose hard gaze
will be still there, when we have long since moved away
and house and street and town 
have vanished – so undeterredly
far, so lustrous, so above the east and west
that one could navigate through darkness
by him, offering old sailors consolation. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when october hung them among the leaves, those
bulging lanterns, then it was time: we picked ripe
quinces, lugged the baskets of yellow bounty into the kitchen,
soused the fruits in water. the pears and apples
grew towards their names, to a simple sweetness –
unlike quinces, clinging to branches in some shadowy border’s
alphabet, obscure in our garden’s latin,
tough and foreign in their aroma. we cut,
quartered, cored the flesh (we were four adult hands,two somewhat smaller),
veiled by clouds of steam from the blender, poured in
sugar, heat and effort to something that – raw – 
made our palates baulk. but then who could, who would hope to explain them:
quinces, jellied, lined up in bellied jars on
shelves and set aside for the darkness, stored for
harsher days, a cellar of days, in which they shone, are still shining.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have sewn diamonds into the hem of your skirt so that you can buy bread
I have put your teddy in the rucksack and a jar of jam as well, but ssshh
I have rolled your slips under the sheets you must unpack them quickly
I have stuffed the papers right to the bottom of this bag, so that no one, you know
I have stitched a little money into the coat perhaps you can
I have grandfather’s watch in the vase by the window they shouldn’t stop you
I have put a pen in this envelope and with it a letter to your uncle, give it to him
I have removed the star from your jacket it's better that way
I have burnt all the stars now every night is black
It seems I have given all my advice now I have none left
I have sewn diamonds into the hem of your skirt but ssshh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I leave this hut,
Where my beloved dwells,
Walk with muffled steps
Through the desolate dark wood:
The moon breaks through bush and oak-trees,
The West Wind announces her presence,
And the bowing birch-trees strew
Sweetest incense in her path.
How exquisite is the coolness
Of this beautiful summer night!
O how I feel in this silence
What fills the heart with happiness!
Its rapture can scarcely be grasped;
And yet, O heaven, I would forego
A thousand such nights,
If my beloved would grant me one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, they are the self-same eyes
That still brighten as I greet her,
Yes, they are the self-same lips
That made all my life seem sweeter.
Yes, it is the very voice,
At whose slightest tones I faltered.
But no more the same am I;
I wend homeward strangely altered.
By the fair white arms embraced
With a close and tender passion,
Now I lie upon her heart,
Dull of brain, in cold vexation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star falls to earth
From its glittering height,
That is the star of love
I see falling there.
The apple tree sheds
A host of white leaves,
Cajoling breezes come along
And play with them.
A swan sings on the lake,
Gliding to and fro,
And singing ever more softly
Dives into its watery grave.
It is so silent and dark,
Blossom and leaf have dispersed,
The star has guttered and gone out,
The song of the swan has faded away.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Migrating birds from every branch 
Rise up into the air,
Resounding far through the skies
The travelling chorus can be heard:
To the South, to the South
Into the eternal blossoming
Little birds, you sing merrily from on high,
We sing out merrily too;
When Spring comes
We shall return,
Return to nest and home
From the South! But now – let’s away!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaded by blossoming branches,
Cooled by playful west winds,
Rosalis lay here by the brook
With Hylas by her side.
Playfully, they sang to each other,
Showering each other with blossom;
She teased him, he teased her,
Who knows how long or how?
Moved by love and springtime,
Hylas was tempted to steal a kiss;
He kissed her, he hugged her,
So that she cried for help.
Her mother ran up and asked Hylas
What crime he was committing there;
The daughter cried out: it’s all over now,
You can go away again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sloth, now at last I must sing
A short hymn of praise to you. –
Oh how ti ring I find it,
To extol you as you deserve!
Still, I shall do my best,
After labour, rest is sweet.
Highest boon! Whoever has you,
His untroubled life
Ah! I yawn I grow weary
Well please forgive me then,
If I cannot sing your praises;
You are, you see, preventing me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At midnight, as a very little boy, I would walk,
Far from willingly, past that churchyard
To father’s vicarage; star on star,
How beautifully they all shone;
At midnight.
When further on in life I had to go
To my beloved, had to because she drew me on,
I saw the stars and Northern Lights compete;
I came, I went, drinking in her bliss;
At midnight.
Until at last the moon’s full radiance
Pierced my darkness so clearly and brightly,
That also my thoughts, willingly, meaningfully, swiftly
Embraced the past and the future;
At midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From door to door will I steal,
Quiet and humble will I stand,
A pious hand will pass food,
And I shall go on my way.
Each will think himself happy,
Seeing me before him,
A tear will he weep,
And I shall not know why.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------He whom God would show true favour,
He sends him out into the wide world
And points out His miracles
In mountain and wood and river and field.
The indolent ones who laze at home
Are not refreshed by the dawn;
They only know about rearing children,
About cares, burdens and the need for bread.
The brooklets spring from the mountains,
The larks whirr high with pleasure;
Why should I not sing with them
With full throat and fresh spirit?
I let dear God alone prevail;
He who sustains brook, lark, wind and field,
And earth and sky,
Has also ordered my life for the best.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From my homeland, beyond the red lightning,
The clouds come drifting in,
But father and mother have long been dead,
Now no one knows me there.
How soon, ah! how soon till that quiet time
When I too shall rest
Beneath the sweet murmur of lonely woods,
Forgotten here as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bear your beautiful likeness
Deep within my heart,
It gazes at me every hour
So freshly and happily.
My heart sings softly to itself
An old and beautiful song
That soars into the sky
And swiftly wings its way to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is already late, already cold,
Why ride lonely through the forest?
The forest is long, you are alone,
You lovely bride! I’ll lead you home!
‘Great is the deceit and cunning of men,
My heart is broken with grief,
The hunting horn echoes here and there,
O flee! You do not know who I am.’
So richly adorned are steed and lady,
So wondrous fair her youthful form,
Now I know you—may God protect me!
You are the enchantress Lorelei.
‘You know me well—from its towering rock
My castle looks silently into the Rhine.
It is already late, already cold,
You shall never leave this forest again!’
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one knows and no one can guess
How happy I am, how happy!
If only one, just one person knew,
No one else ever should!
The snow outside is not so silent,
Nor are the stars on high
So still and taciturn
As my own thoughts.
I wish I were a little bird,
And could fly across the sea,
Across the sea and further,
Until I were in heaven!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as though Heaven
Had softly kissed the Earth,
So that she in a gleam of blossom
Had only to dream of him.
The breeze passed through the fields,
The corn swayed gently to and fro,
The forests murmured softly,
The night was so clear with stars.
And my soul spread
Her wings out wide,
Flew across the silent land,
As though flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tree-tops rustle and shudder
As if at this very hour
The ancient gods
Were pacing these half-sunken walls.
Here beyond the myrtle trees
In secret twilit splendour,
What are you saying, fantastic night,
Obscurely, as in a dream?
The glittering stars gaze down on me,
Fierily and full of love,
The distant horizon speaks with rapture
Of some great happiness to come!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up there at his look-out
The old knight has fallen asleep;
Rain-storms pass overhead,
And the wood stirs through the portcullis.
Beard and hair matted together,
Ruff and breast turned to stone,
For centuries he’s sat up there
In his silent cell.
Outside it’s quiet and peaceful,
All have gone down to the valley,
Forest birds sing lonely songs
In the empty window-arches.
Down there on the sunlit Rhine
A wedding-party’s sailing by,
Musicians strike up merrily,
And the lovely bride—weeps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hear the brooklets murmuring
Through the forest, here and there,
In the forest, in the murmuring
I do not know where I am.
Nightingales are singing
Here in the solitude,
As though they wished to tell
Of lovely days now past.
The moonlight flickers,
As though I saw below me
The castle in the valley,
Yet it lies so far from here!
As though in the garden,
Full of roses, white and red,
My love were waiting for me,
Yet she died so long ago.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
True, I can sometimes sing
As though I were content;
But secretly tears well up,
And my heart is set free.
Nightingales, when spring breezes
Play outside, sing
Their song of longing
From their dungeon cell.
Then all hearts listen
And everyone rejoices,
Yet no one feels the pain,
The deep sorrow in the song.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dusk is about to spread its wings,
The trees now shudder and stir,
Clouds drift by like oppressive dreams—
What can this dusk and dread imply?
If you have a fawn you favour,
Do not let her graze alone,
Hunters sound their horns through the forest,
Voices wander to and fro.
If here on earth you have a friend,
Do not trust him at this hour,
Though his eyes and lips be smiling,
In treacherous peace he’s scheming war.
That which wearily sets today,
Will rise tomorrow, newly born.
Much can go lost in the night—
Be wary, watchful, on your guard!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A wedding procession wound over the mountain,
I heard the warbling of birds,
Riders flashed by, hunting horns peeled,
That was a merry chase!
And before I knew, all had faded,
Darkness covers the land,
Only the forest sighs from the mountain,
And deep in my heart I quiver with fear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the garden, through the air
I heard birds of passage fly,
A sign that spring is in the air,
Flowers already bloom below.
I could shout for joy, could weep,
For it seems to me it cannot be!
All the old wonders come flooding back,
Gleaming in the moonlight.
And the moon and stars say it,
And the dreaming forest whispers it,
And the nightingales sing it:
‘She is yours, is yours!’
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all forests were sleeping,
He began to dig.
Ceaselessly in the mountain gorge
He dug for treasure.
God’s angels sang
The while in the silent night;
Like red eyes,
Metals emerged from the shaft.
‘You shall be mine!’ More grimly
He burrows and burrows down,
Stones and rubbles
Fall in on the fool.
Wild mocking laughter echoed
From the crumbled vault.
The song of angels died away
Sadly in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two sturdy lads set out
From home for the first time,
Exultantly into the bright,
Sounding and singing waves
Of springtime at its height.
They strove for lofty things,
Desired, despite joy and pain,
To achieve something in the world,
And those they passed on their way
Were happy in heart and mind.
The first, he found a loved one;
Her family bought them house and home.
Soon he was rocking a baby boy,
And gazing from a homely room,
At ease into his field.
The second was sung and lied to
By a thousand voices from the deep—
Enticing sirens, who drew him
Into the amorous waves,
The oceans’ colourful deep.
And when he surfaced from the deep,
He was weary and old,
His vessel lay on the sea bed,
Such silence reigned around him,
And the wind blew cold above the waves.
The waves of spring are singing
And sounding above me now;
And when I see such bold lads,
Tears come welling to my eyes—
Ah, guide us, God, lovingly to Thee!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, comfort of the world, quiet night!
How softly you climb from the hills,
The breezes are all sleeping,
One sailor still, travel-wearied,
Sings over the water his evening song
In praise of God in the harbour.
The years, like the clouds, go by
And leave me here in solitude,
Forgotten by the world,
Then wondrously you came to me,
As I sat here lost in thought
Beside the murmuring wood.
O comfort of the world, quiet night!
The day has tired me so,
The wide sea darkens now,
Let me rest from joy and pain,
Until eternal dawn
Flashes through the silent wood.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From my homeland, beyond the red lightning,
The clouds come drifting in,
But father and mother have long been dead,
Now no one knows me there.
How soon, ah! how soon till that quiet time
When I too shall rest
Beneath the sweet murmur of lonely woods,
Forgotten here as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as though Heaven
Had softly kissed the Earth,
So that she in a gleam of blossom
Had only to dream of him.
The breeze passed through the fields,
The corn swayed gently to and fro,
The forests murmured softly,
The night was so clear with stars.
And my soul spread
Her wings out wide,
Flew across the silent land,
As though flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the sun were to shine gently
As in Italy, from warm, blue skies,
I would go with my mandoline
Through the sun-drenched meadow.
In the night my love would listen
From her window, sweetly awake,
And she would wish both of us,
In secret, a lovely night.
If the sun were to shine gently
As in Italy, from warm, blue skies,
I would go with my mandoline
Through the sun-drenched meadow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daylight has departed,
The sound of bells comes from afar;
Thus time moves on throughout the night,
Taking many an unwitting soul.
Where now is all the garish joy,
The comforting breast of a faithful friend,
The sweet light of the loved one’s eyes?
Will no one stay awake with me?
Strike up then, dear nightingale,
You cascade of bright sound!
Together we shall praise God,
Until the light of morning dawns!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She stood at the arched window
And sadly braided her hair.
The huntsman had departed,
Who was her lover.
And when the spring came,
The world was snowed under with blossom,
And she took fresh heart
And went out into the green heath.
She puts her ear to the turf,
Hears the sound of distant hooves:
The deer that are grazing
On the shaded mountainside.
And at evening the forests rustle,
A single shot can be heard in the distance,
She stands still to listen:
‘That was my lover’s greeting!’
The springs then leapt from the cliff,
The little birds then fled to the valley!
‘And wherever you meet him, friends,
Oh greet him from me a thousand times!’
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High over silent heights
A house stood in the forest;
It looked so lonely there,
Gazing out over the forest.
A girl sat inside
At silent eventide,
Spinning silken threads
For her wedding dress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I walk and gaze,
Through valley, wood and field,
From mountaintop to meadow:
I, lovely gracious lady,
Greet you a thousand times.
I seek out in my garden
Many fine and lovely flowers,
Weaving many garlands,
Binding a thousand thoughts
And greetings with them too.
I cannot give her a garland
She is too noble and lovely,
They would all perish,
But love without compare
Remains forever in my heart.
I appear to be of good cheer,
And continue busily though my work,
And though my heart may break,
I shall dig away and sing
And shortly dig my grave.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gentle rustling in the treetops,
Little birds flying afar,
Springs bursting from silent peaks,
Tell me where my homeland lies.
Today in a dream I saw it again,
And from all the mountains
Such a greeting descended
That I began to weep.
Ah! here on these foreign peaks:
People, springs, rock and tree –
All seems to me a dream!
Blithe birds in the treetops,
You, my friends, down in the valley,
Greet for me, from these foreign peaks,
My homeland a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I walk and gaze,
Through valley, wood and field,
From mountaintop to meadow,
I, lovely gracious lady,
Greet you a thousand times.
I seek out in my garden
Many fine and lovely flowers,
Weaving many garlands,
Binding a thousand thoughts
And greetings with them too.
I cannot give a garland
To her, so high and fine,
Which means that all must perish,
Only love without compare
Stays in the heart forever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Were it dark, I’d lie in the forest,
The forest murmurs so softly,
With her cloak of stars
The night covers me there,
The brooklets steal up and ask:
If I’m not already asleep.
I do not sleep, for long yet I’ll listen
To the nightingales,
When the treetops sway above me,
They sound the whole night through,
They are the heart’s own thoughts
That sing when no one’s awake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read the truth deep within you;
Do not conceal from me
What magic being
Speaks from your voice.
So many words
Reach our ears to no purpose;
They are forgotten
Even before they die away.
But your tones can reach
My ear even from afar;
I delight to hear them,
I never forget their least murmur.
Then I tremble, kindled
With sudden fire;
My heart and your voice
Understand each other only too well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I leapt up in the night, in the night,
And felt myself drawn onward,
I left the streets, patrolled by the watch,
Quietly walked on
In the night, in the night,
Through the gate with the Gothic arch.
The millstream rushed through the rocky gorge,
I leaned over the bridge,
Far below me I watched the waves
That flowed so quietly
In the night, in the night,
But not a single wave ever flowed back.
The countless, kindled stars above
Went on their melodious way,
With them the moon in tranquil spendour –
They glittered quietly
In the night, in the night,
Through deceptively distant space.
I gazed aloft in the night, in the night,
And gazed down again once more;
Oh how have you spent your days, alas,
Now quietly silence
In the night, in the night,
The remorse that pounds in your heart!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I creep about,
Troubled and silent,
You ask me – oh, ask
Me not – why?
My heart is shaken
By so much pain!
And could I ever
Be too gloomy?
The tree withers,
Fragrance fades,
Leaves lie so yellow
In the flowerbed.
A heavy shower
Comes storming up,
And could I ever
Be too gloomy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The river that rushed by me, where is it now?
The bird whose song I listened to, where is it now?
Where is the rose my love wore on her heart,
And that kiss which entranced me, where is it now?
And that man I used to be, and whom I long ago
Exchanged for another self, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You tell me I was mistaken,
You swore it by all you hold dear,
Yet I know you loved me once,
But no longer love me now!
Your beautiful eyes smouldered,
Your kisses even more,
You loved me once, confess it,
But no longer love me now!
I do not ever expect you
To love me faithfully again;
Just confess you loved me once
And no longer love me now!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has lied, 
Sorrow oppresses me,
I am betrayed, ah, betrayed
By all around!
Hot tears keep flowing 
Down my cheeks,
Beat no more, my heart,
Wretched heart, beat no more! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is broken, you do not love me!
You let me know you do not love me!
Though I wooed you and beseeched you
With devotion, you do not love me!
You told me so, you said it in words, 
All too clearly, you do not love me!
So must I forgo the stars, forgo the moon
And the sun? You do not love me!
Why does the rose bloom? Why the jasmine?
Why the narcissus? You do not love me! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eyes are dim, my lips are silent,
You tell me to speak—so be it, then!
Your eyes are bright, your lips are red,
And all that you wish is one command.
My hair is grey, my heart is sore,
You are so young and so healthy!
You tell me to speak, and make it so hard.
I look at you so and tremble so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since first seeing him,
I think I am blind,
Wherever I look,
Him only I see;
As in a waking dream
His image hovers before me,
Rising out of deepest darkness
Ever more brightly.
All else is dark and pale
Around me,
My sisters’ games
I no more long to share,
I would rather weep
Quietly in my room;
Since first seeing him,
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most wonderful of all,
How gentle and loving he is!
Sweet lips, bright eyes,
A clear mind and firm resolve.
Just as there in the deep-blue distance
That star gleams bright and brilliant,
So does he shine in my sky,
Bright and brilliant, distant and sublime.
Wander, wander on your way,
Just to gaze on your radiance,
Just to gaze on in humility,
To be but blissful and sad!
Do not heed my silent prayer,
Uttered for your happiness alone,
You shall never know me, lowly as I am,
You noble star of splendour!
Only the worthiest woman of all
May your choice elate,
And I shall bless that exalted one
Many thousands of times.
Then shall I rejoice and weep,
Blissful, blissful shall I be,
Even if my heart should break,
Break, O heart, what does it matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot grasp it, believe it,
A dream has beguiled me;
How, from all women, could he
Have exalted and favoured poor me?
He said, I thought,
‘I am yours forever’,
I was, I thought, still dreaming,
After all, it can never be.
O let me, dreaming, die,
Cradled on his breast;
Let me savour blissful death
In tears of endless joy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ring,
I press you devoutly to my lips,
To my heart.
I had finished dreaming
Childhood’s peaceful dream,
I found myself alone, forlorn
In boundless desolation.
You ring on my finger,
You first taught me,
Opened my eyes
To life’s deep eternal worth.
I shall serve him, live for him,
Belong to him wholly,
Yield to him and find
Myself transfigured in his light.
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ring,
I press you devoutly to my lips,
To my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, my sisters,
With my bridal attire,
Serve me today in my joy,
Busily braid
About my brow
The wreath of blossoming myrtle.
When with contentment
And joy in my heart
I lay in my beloved’s arms,
He still called,
With longing heart,
Impatiently for this day.
Help me, my sisters,
Help me banish
A foolish fearfulness;
So that I with bright eyes
May receive him,
The source of all my joy.
Have you, my love,
Really entered my life,
Do you, O sun, give me your glow?
Let me in reverence,
Let me in humility
Bow before my lord.
Scatter flowers, O sisters,
Scatter flowers before him,
Bring him budding roses.
But you, sisters,
I greet with sadness,
As I joyfully take leave of you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
At me in wonder,
You cannot understand
How I can weep;
Let the unfamiliar beauty
Of these moist pearls
Tremble joyfully bright
In my eyes!
How anxious my heart is,
How full of bliss!
If only I knew
How to say it in words;
Come and hide your face
Here against my breast,
For me to whisper you
All my joy.
Do you now understand the tears
That I can weep,
Should you not see them,
Beloved husband?
Stay by my heart,
Feel how it beats,
That I may press you
Closer and closer.
Here by my bed
There is room for the cradle,
Silently hiding
My blissful dream;
The morning shall come
When the dream awakens,
And your likeness
Laughs up at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, at my breast,
You my delight, my joy!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I’ve always said and say so still.
I thought myself rapturous,
But now am delirious with joy.
Only she who suckles, only she who loves
The child that she nourishes;
Only a mother knows
What it means to love and be happy.
Ah, how I pity the man
Who cannot feel a mother’s bliss!
You dear, dear angel, you,
You look at me and you smile!
On my heart, at my breast,
You my delight, my joy!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have caused me my first pain,
But it struck hard,
You sleep, you harsh and pitiless man,
The sleep of death.
The deserted one stares ahead,
The world is void.
I have loved and I have lived,
And now my life is done.
Silently I withdraw into myself,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
You, my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adorned with myrtle and her bridal jewels,
The keeper’s daughter, the rosy maid,
Steps into the lion’s cage;
At his mistress’s feet the lion, fawning, lies.
The powerful beast, once wild and untamed,
Looks up at his mistress, understanding and meek;
The gentle and radiant girl
Caresses him tenderly, weeping the while:
‘We were in the days that now are past
True playmates, like two children,
And loved and liked each other;
Those days of childhood are long since gone.
‘Before we could believe it, you were shaking
Your mighty, mane-rippling regal head;
I grew up too, as you can see: I am
No longer a child with a childish mind.
‘Were I still that child, and could stay with you,
My strong, faithful, my honest beast!
But I must follow—they have decreed it—
A stranger, far off into foreign lands.
‘He thought me beautiful,
I was wooed, and now it is done:
The wreath, trusty friend, garlands my hair,
And my eyes are now dim with tears.
‘Do you really understand? You look at me wildly,
But I am resigned, and you must be too;
I see him coming whom I must follow,
So I’ll give you, my friend, a final kiss.’
And as the girl’s lips touched his own,
The cage was seen to shake,
And as he glimpsed the young man outside the cage,
The anxious bride was seized with terror.
He stands on guard by the door of the cage,
He lashes his tail and roars with might;
She pleads with him, issuing orders and threats,
To let her out; angrily, he won’t let her pass.
A confused shouting is heard outside.
The young man cries: ‘Bring arms,
I’ll fire at him, I’ll shoot him down!’
Provoked, the growling lion foams with rage.
The luckless girl dares to approach the door,
The changed beast falls on his mistress:
Her fair form, now a fearful prey,
Lies bleeding and mangled in the dust.
And having shed that dear blood,
The lion lies brooding down by the corpse,
Sunk in grief and sunk in sorrow,
Until the fatal bullet strikes his heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky arches clear and blue;
The hoar-frost fashions flowers.
The window-pane gleams with shimmering blossom,
A young man stands there, looking on.
And blossoming behind those flowers
Is a pair of smiling blue eyes.
March violets, sweeter than he’d ever seen.
A single breath will melt the frost.
The icy flowers begin to thaw—
May the Lord have mercy on that young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A mother prays fervently and looks
With joy at her little slumbering son;
He sleeps in the cradle all snug and warm,
To her he must seem like an angel.
She kisses and hugs him; can hardly restrain herself,
Forgetting all her earthly sorrows;
Her hopes and dreams hover in the future;
That’s how all mothers dream in their hearts.
The raven meanwhile with its brood
Croaks this tune outside the window:
Your angel, your angel shall be our prey!
We shall peck at the robber as food!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He walks to the sound of the muffled drum;
How far away the place! how long the way!
Ah, were he at rest and all this done!
My heart, I think, will break in two.
None but him in the world have I loved,
Him, who now they’re putting to death.
The firing squad parades will full band,
I too am detailed for the task.
Now he takes his last look
At the joyous rays of God’s sun,—
Now they’re blindfolding him,—
May God grant you eternal peace!
The nine of us took good aim,
Eight bullets whistled wide of the mark;
Every man shook with pity and grief—
But I, I shot him clean through the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the little town there’s much rejoicing,
They’re holding a wedding with music and dance,
The happy man quaffs the glinting red wine,
But the bride is as pale as death.
She is dead for the one she cannot forget,
Who’s at the feast but not as the groom;
He stands among the guests at the inn,
And plays his fiddle gaily enough!
He plays his fiddle, his hair turns grey,
The strings resound shrill and loud,
He presses the fiddle to his heart, heedless
If it shatters in a thousand pieces.
It’s hideous for a man to die in this way,
When his heart’s still young and striving for joy;
I cannot and will not watch any more!
My head might reel in a fatal whirl.—
Who said to point a finger at me?
O God—have mercy,
Let none of us go mad;
I too am just a poor musician.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since first seeing him,
I think I am blind,
Wherever I look,
Him only I see;
As in a waking dream
His image hovers before me,
Rising out of deepest darkness
Ever more brightly.
All else is dark and pale
Around me,
My sisters’ games
I no more long to share,
I would rather weep
Quietly in my room;
Since first seeing him,
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most wonderful of all,
How gentle and loving he is!
Sweet lips, bright eyes,
A clear mind and firm resolve.
Just as there in the deep-blue distance
That star gleams bright and brilliant,
So does he shine in my sky,
Bright and brilliant, distant and sublime.
Wander, wander on your way,
Just to gaze on your radiance,
Just to gaze on in humility,
To be but blissful and sad!
Do not heed my silent prayer,
Uttered for your happiness alone,
You shall never know me, lowly as I am,
You noble star of splendour!
Only the worthiest woman of all
May your choice elate,
And I shall bless that exalted one
Many thousands of times.
Then shall I rejoice and weep,
Blissful, blissful shall I be,
Even if my heart should break,
Break, O heart, what does it matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot grasp it, believe it,
A dream has beguiled me;
How, from all women, could he
Have exalted and favoured poor me?
He said, I thought,
‘I am yours forever’,
I was, I thought, still dreaming,
After all, it can never be.
O let me, dreaming, die,
Cradled on his breast;
Let me savour blissful death
In tears of endless joy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ring,
I press you devoutly to my lips,
To my heart.
I had finished dreaming
Childhood’s peaceful dream,
I found myself alone, forlorn
In boundless desolation.
You ring on my finger,
You first taught me,
Opened my eyes
To life’s deep eternal worth.
I shall serve him, live for him,
Belong to him wholly,
Yield to him and find
Myself transfigured in his light.
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ring,
I press you devoutly to my lips,
To my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, my sisters,
With my bridal attire,
Serve me today in my joy,
Busily braid
About my brow
The wreath of blossoming myrtle.
When with contentment
And joy in my heart
I lay in my beloved’s arms,
He still called,
With longing heart,
Impatiently for this day.
Help me, my sisters,
Help me banish
A foolish fearfulness;
So that I with bright eyes
May receive him,
The source of all my joy.
Have you, my love,
Really entered my life,
Do you, O sun, give me your glow?
Let me in reverence,
Let me in humility
Bow before my lord.
Scatter flowers, O sisters,
Scatter flowers before him,
Bring him budding roses.
But you, sisters,
I greet with sadness,
As I joyfully take leave of you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
At me in wonder,
You cannot understand
How I can weep;
Let the unfamiliar beauty
Of these moist pearls
Tremble joyfully bright
In my eyes!
How anxious my heart is,
How full of bliss!
If only I knew
How to say it in words;
Come and hide your face
Here against my breast,
For me to whisper you
All my joy.
Do you now understand the tears
That I can weep,
Should you not see them,
Beloved husband?
Stay by my heart,
Feel how it beats,
That I may press you
Closer and closer.
Here by my bed
There is room for the cradle,
Silently hiding
My blissful dream;
The morning shall come
When the dream awakens,
And your likeness
Laughs up at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, at my breast,
You my delight, my joy!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I’ve always said and say so still.
I thought myself rapturous,
But now am delirious with joy.
Only she who suckles, only she who loves
The child that she nourishes;
Only a mother knows
What it means to love and be happy.
Ah, how I pity the man
Who cannot feel a mother’s bliss!
You dear, dear angel, you,
You look at me and you smile!
On my heart, at my breast,
You my delight, my joy!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have caused me my first pain,
But it struck hard,
You sleep, you harsh and pitiless man,
The sleep of death.
The deserted one stares ahead,
The world is void.
I have loved and I have lived,
And now my life is done.
Silently I withdraw into myself,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
You, my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream of my own days
That now are distant,
Daughter of my daughter,
You sweet child of mine.
Take, before the weary one
Is covered by a shroud,
Take into your young life
My own blessing.
You see me grey-haired,
Emaciated and pale.
Once I was like you,
Young and blissful.
I loved, as you now love,
Became, like you, a bride,
And you too will grow old,
Like my hair has turned grey.
Let time fly
On and on,
But preserve for ever
The treasure of your heart;
What I once said
I shall not take back:
Happiness alone is love,
Love alone is happiness.
When I buried
The man I loved,
I cherished my love
In my faithful heart:
Though my heart was broken,
My courage stood firm,
And the ashes of old age
Preserve the sacred glow.
Take, before the weary one
Is covered by a shroud,
Take into your young life
My own blessing:
If your heart must break,
May your courage stand firm,
May love’s sorrow then be
Your dearest possession.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That night we kissed each other, O maiden,
No one was observing us.
The stars, which stood in the sky—
We confided only in those stars.
It was one star that fell,
And accused us to the sea;
Then the sea told it to a rudder,
And the rudder told it to a sailor.
That same sailor sang it
To his sweetheart.
Now, on the streets and in the market,
The boys and girls sing of it in chorus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surrounded by dear friends,
I’ve often rested in fragrant grass
And sung to myself a little song –
And all was well and good.
I’ve also grieved in solitude,
Fearfully and gloomily,
And as soon as I sang again,
All was well again.
And much that I’ve suffered
I’ve suppressed in silent rage,
And when I came to sing again,
All was well again.
You should not spend time moaning to us
About all that gives you grief,
Just sing out, sing out,
And all will be well again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I set out in an unhappy hour,
Love was weeping so much,
My foot was sore, my shoulder hurt,
My heart was weighing me down.
Birds, why are you singing in the dawn?
You don’t know the pain of parting!
Worries don’t depress you, shoes don’t pinch you;
How fortunate, birds, you are!
