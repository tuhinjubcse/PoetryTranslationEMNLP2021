I think of you,
When the sun shines on me
From the sea shone;
I think of you,
When the shimmer of the moon
In fountains painted.
I see you,
When on the distant way
The dust rises,
In the deep night,
When on the slender stee
The wanderer trembles.
I hear you,
When there, with dumb smoke,
The wave rises.
In the still grove I often go to listen,
When all is silent.
I am with you,
Though you be so far away,
You are near me.
The sun sinks,
soon the stars will be lit.
O would you be there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
enfolds the city and park
over the reason why the summer burns
the sails of the smoke.
first we sacrifice your freedom, sweetest
and receive the gabe of the language for that
exhausted and dissolved lie the bodies
in the shadow of the talk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh food, new blood
I plunge from the free world:
How is nature so hold and good,
That holds me on my breast!
The wave whispers to our cupboard
Rising in full stead,
And mountains, low in the sky,
Beggin our way along.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aug, my eye, where do you sink?
Gold dreams, are you returning?
Fare you dream! so gold you are:
Here love and life are.
On the wave there are a thousand spinning stars,
Soft fogs drink the barren distance;
Morning wind whirls round The shadowy bay,
And in the lake the ripening fruit reflects itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
then the supplementary yearning takes place
when yearning adds the one
but the fulfillment, so it could be, was missing.
as evening by the window in the dripping light
the unknown connects the absolute
and the distance unfolds itself into the wide. i call
I want nothing from what I already know!
otherwise there are cold solitudes
as it is in pariser restaurants cold huhn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the captivated, this Frog lay
bound on the hot asphalt
The Landstrasse. Open mouths
Bow to the heavens of sunshine,
What glinted from afar a sock of shoes –
A hummingbird from ancient earth-time,
Beneath the wheels on the wing.
No rebirth but in the lilac
Of the flies that will plup tomorrow.
Through which opening does the dream evade?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They feel a feeling of emptiness
Something deep in your inner self
Neiderfilled they gaze round
How wish they were another
Give yourself to our hand
We will transform them
without hesitation
into their opposite
They fly
We dry them up
They are wound
We stimulate your juices
They strive to be a man
We change their anatomies
They bend to gentleness
We will tempt you into railing
They scurdled outward
We invert your gaze
They doubt
We guarantee it all the time
They are angry
We'll hang them
on their teeth
under the circus dome
They rest within themselves
We rip them into bits
They breathe health
We dry them up
If in you
as late follower
the wish to come true
to be a man with his differences
we return them to the middle
The magicians and magnitors of the house
stand to their service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sister of the first light,
Picture of tenderness in sorrow!
Mists are swimming with silver showers
Upon your delectable face;
Your leisure footstep
wakes from day-dreaming caverns
Traurly departed souls,
Myself and the nocturnal birds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hardly in the wand, he was the midst,
his radius accelerated
over the gardens, fields and groves,
the chicken-houses, the radius-
chen bed, became broader, world wide:
we hung up the cover. we tied string-
jackets and racks, hanging rain suits
and shutter up until we almost lost sight of him, whose harder look
will still be there when we've been stripped
and city and house and street
are gone – so unheeded far above,
so glowing over the west and east,
that it could be navigued in the dark
For him, and old sailors a sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when the autumn hung on to the stalk,
had come the time: we
plucked quitten, whistled körbeweise yellow in the pool
under the water. apples and peaches ripening
To her name, to a simple sweetness –
different than the quitte on her branch in the hinterst corner
of the letters of myalphabet, in the lay of a garden,
hard and foreign in its aroma. we cut
triplicated the flesh (four large hands, two small),
brightly in the steam of the engine, delivering
tocker, heat, exhaust, fatigue to something that takes
to the mouth. who could, wanted to quit,
she breathes, in foamy glasses for the
dark days are piled in the cupboards
grows, in a chamber of days where they glowed, glowing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've tied diamonds in your shirt so you can buy bread
I put the sleeping bird in the carrying bag and a glass of milk, but psssst
I rolled your underwear under the sheet, you need to pack them quickly
I have stuffed the papers in this purse down below, so don't you think I know
I put a little money in my mantle, maybe you can
I put grandfather's watch in the vase at the window, they shall not stop you
I've got a pen in this envelope and a letter to the oncle, give it to him
I have stripped the star from my jacket, so it is better
I have burnt the stars all, now every night is black
It seems I have taken all the advices, now I no longer have
I wove diamonds in your hood but sssst
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I have left this hide,
Of my dearest stay,
Wandle with folded steps
Through the barren forests, the woods glow:
Luna breaks through bushes and oaks,
Zephyr announces its course
And the birds strewn with nests
Give yours the sweet Weihrauch.
How would I need my self in the heat
Of this beautiful summer night!
O how still it is here to feel
What makes the soul happy!
Can hardly grasp the joy,
And yet I wished to you, heaven,
Thousands of such nights are left,
Would give my girl one to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah, the eyes are it again,
Who once so sweetly greeted me,
And it is the lips that are again,
Who kissed the life for me.
And voice is it again,
Who I once so much loved!
But I myself am not again,
I have returned changed home.
Of the white, lovely arms
Fest and enriched with love,
I lie now upon her heart,
Foolish of senses and decayed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star falls below
Out of his fluttering cavity,
That is the star of love
That I see falling there.
They drop from the Apple tree,
The white leaves so much,
The shivering breezes come
And so they play their game.
The swan sings in the grove,
And roars up and down,
And always singing softly,
He wanders into the flooded grave.
It is so still and dark
Wreathed are leaf and flower,
The star is scurrying with stars,
Purged the swaying song.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From all the branches
Wandering birds upwards,
Far through the breezes sound
We hear the Chorus of the Road
To the south, to the north
Into the eternal flora.
The bird sings merrily down the stairs
We sing out of town,
When the spring comes,
We will come again,
Again into nest and house,
From the South! But now go out!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
flanked by blooming boughs,
Cooled by the whirling west,
Rosilis lay here by the stream
And Hylas beside her.
They sang sighing songs,
She stroked him with flowers, he again;
She neced him, he necked her,
Who knows how long and how.
Of spring and of love touched,
Drinking the Ward of Hylas to kiss.
He kissed her, he pressed her
That she cried for help.
The mother came hurrying to ask,
What was Hylas for Frevel here?
The daughter cried, "It is done,
You may now go again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Faulty, at last must I give you
Even a little praise singing. –
Oh how dear it will be to me
To worship you with dignity.
But I will do my best
After work is good rest.
Höchste Gut! Whoever has thee
Whose unstressed life
Oh! I yawn I'm ashamed
So may you give it to me,
That I cannot sing thee;
You're hurting me too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About midnight I went, not as much as I would like,
Little little boy, to that cherry-house
To the chamber of my father; star upon stars,
They all gleamed all too fair;
By midnight.
If then, farther, into the vastness of life,
To his lover, to his wife, because he died,
Winds and gleams of the North over me in disputes,
I come, coming with seldomnesses;
By midnight.
Until the end of the full moon
So clear and clear that it struck me in the heart
Even the thought willing, sinnig, quick
Stirring about his deceased self as the next one's;
By midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to slip at the doors
I will stand still and silent;
The humble hand shall reach thee,
And I shall go on.
Each will seem to be happy,
When my image appears before him;
A tear will he cry,
And I know not what it whispers.
Whose grace shall be shown to him,
He sends it to the wide world,
To whom he will impart his wonders
In mountain and forest and power and field.
The tears that lie home,
Does not stir the dawn,
They know only of the children's waves,
Of sorrow, burden, and need of bread.
The little Brooks spring from the Hills,
The lark is scurrying high to desire,
Why should I not sing with them
From a cheek full of keenness and a fresh breast.
I bid my dear God fight for me;
The brook, lark, wind and field,
And earth and heaven will keep,
And so has my deeds been dealt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashing red
There the clouds come
But father and mother have long since died,
There none knows me more.
How soon, how soon will the quiet time come,
There I rest, and above me
The beautiful forest loneliness murmurs
And no one knows me more here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your image is marvelous
Have I found in my heart,
That looks so fresh and joyful
Come to me every hour.
My heart sings still
An old, pleasant song
Floating in the air
And draws on to you in scorn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's already late, it is already cold,
What are you riding lonely through the woods?
The woods are long, you are alone,
You beautiful bride! I'll take you home
"Prison is great to men's courage,
My heart is broken with pain,
Well does the foresthorse go on and on,
O fly! You don't know who I am."
So rich are Negro and Gentleman,
So beautiful the young body
Now I know thee—God help me!
You are the queen Lorelei.
"You know me well—of stony stone
My castle stares deep into the Rhine.
It's already late, it is already cold,
You will nevermore come from this forest."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is known and no one can advise it,
How well it is to me, so well!
Oh, wish only One, only one,
No man should know it!
So still is it outside in the snow,
So mute and silent
The stars are not in the height,
As my thoughts are.
I wish I were a bird
And weep over the sea,
Over the sea and onward,
Until I were in heaven!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens had opened
The earth gently kissed,
That, in the glow of blossoms,
Of him you have but to dream.
The air went through the fields,
The branches grew softly,
The woods murmured softly
So star-clear was night.
And my soul was spanking
Far are her wings,
Floated through the silent lands,
As if they fled home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The treetops rustle and shudder,
As if to this hour
About half sunk walls
The old gods the way.
Here behind the myrtle trees
In his own nocturnal splendour
What do you speak foolishly, as in dreams,
To me, phantastic night?
All stars are twinkling on me
With his gaze glowing of love,
It talks from the distance
How of the future great happiness!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleeping on the laurel
Above is the old knight;
Drüben the rain is falling,
And the woods roar through the roof.
Have grown barbs and hair,
And dismantles chest and jaw,
He sat many a hundred years
Above in the stillness of the chamber.
Here it is still and peaceful,
All have flown into the valley,
The wooded birds singing alone
Into the empty window frame.
A wedding journeys down below
On the Rhine in the sun,
The musicians play merrily,
And the beautiful bride who weeps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hear the streams rustle
In the woods past and past,
In the woods, in the rustling
I know not where I am.
The nightingales beat
Here in this solitude
As if they wanted to say something
Of the old, lovely time.
The moonlight glimmers fly,
As if I were under my feet
The castle lies in the valley,
And yet so far from here!
As if in the garden
Full of roses white and red
My love will wait for me,
And is yet so long dead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may sometimes sing,
As if I were merry,
But secretly tears are draining,
There will my heart be free.
It leaves nightingales,
In the springtime air,
The yearning strikes a song
From the crypt of her life.
There listen all hearts
And all is joyful,
But none feels the pain
In song the deep sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkness will whirl the wings,
The trees tremulous are,
Clouds fly like heavy dreams—
What does this grass mean?
Have you a reed dear to thee,
Let it not be grassed alone,
Hunters go in the woods and blase,
voices wandering and wandering.
Have you got a friend,
Do not mourn him at this hour
Kindly, with eye and mouth,
He thinks of war in peace at last.
What we have underneath is weary,
Will be born again tomorrow.
Some things go lost in the night—
Be waking and munter!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There rose a wedding along the mountain,
I heard the birds beat,
There were many riders, the woodhorn sounded,
That was a fun hunting!
And before I thought it was all gone,
The night covers the round;
Only from the mountains the woods return,
And it made me shudder in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the garden through the breeze
I heard wandering birds go,
This is the smell of springtime,
It begins already to bloom here.
I'd like to weep, I would cry,
Is it to me that it cannot be!
The old wonders return
With the moon-glare inside.
And the moon and stars say it,
And in dreams the grove murmurs
And the nightingales beat it:
She is your, she is mine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the woods were sleeping,
He comes to grab his hub,
Rastless in the mountain's deep
For a treasure he fled.
The angels of God sang
While in the silent night,
How red were my eyes
Metalle from the shaft.
"You are mine," said he, and gripped
He cools and warms down!
There smash stones and ruins
Above the fools.
Hollow-laughter rose wildly
From the ruined clay,
The angel's song drooped
Weary in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two wrists of angels rode
For the first time from home
So joyfully into the bright,
Making, singing waves
Out of the full spring.
Who strewed for lofty things
Who did, despite desire and pain,
What is right in the world,
And to whom they went before,
To laughed senses and hearts.
The first one who found a darling
The widows bought a house and a chamber;
That swiftly, like a butterfly,
And saw out of the secret bars
Comfortably off to the field.
To the second they sang and they lie
With a thousand voices in the ground
Exciting sirens, and descended
Into the budding waters,
In the waves of coloured shells.
And as he stumbled from the brink,
There he was weary and old,
His little ship that lay in the ground,
So still was it all around,
And over the water it is cold.
Sound and sing the waves
Of spring upon me;
And I see such keen youths,
The tears are swelling in my eye—
Oh, God, grant us to love thee!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, Trost of the world, you still night!
How do you ride from the mountains softly,
The breezes are all sleeping,
A sailor but still ashore,
Sings over the sea his evening song
To God's praise in the harbour.
The years as the clouds go
And leave me here alone,
The world has forgotten me,
Thou walkest so beautifully with me,
When I am rustling the woods here
Sitting thoughtful.
O Trost of the world, thou silent night!
Day has made me so tired
The wide sea darkens already,
Let me rest from want and need,
Until the eternal dawn
Through the still woods flowing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashing red
There the clouds come
But father and mother have long since died,
There none knows me more.
How soon, how soon will the quiet time come,
There I rest, and above me
The beautiful forest loneliness murmurs
And no one knows me more here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens had opened
The earth gently kissed,
That, in the glow of blossoms,
Of him you have but to dream.
The air went through the fields,
The branches grew softly,
The woods murmured softly
So star-clear was night.
And my soul was spanking
Far are her wings,
Floated through the silent lands,
As if they fled home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welshland low and fair,
I went with the Mandoline
Through the gleaming meadows.
In the night my darling listened
By the window sweetly attended,
And wished to me and you, to us two,
Homely, a pleasant night.
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welshland low and fair,
I went with the Mandoline
Through the gleaming meadows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The light day has passed,
From far away the bells are blowing;
Thus travels time all night
Brings many with him who has not thought of it.
Where now is the bunteous desire
The friend's comfort and the patient breast,
The sweetest glimmer of love?
Will no one be happy with me?
Goodbye then, dear nightingale,
You waterfall with bright sound!
We want to praise God in worship,
Until the light of the morning shines!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She stood at the window's edge
And sadly flowed the hair
The hunter was gone,
The hunter was her lover.
And when spring has come,
The world was full of blossoms,
There has she taken a heart
And went into the green heath.
She puts her ear to the green,
Hear the distant footsteps –
These are the reeds, the grass
On the sleek mountain-side.
And at night the woods rustle,
From far away, still a swell falls,
There she stands to listen in silence:
"That was my dearest greet," said she,
There sprang from the cliff the springs,
There the birds fled to the valley.
"And where you meet him, ye saints,
O, greet me him a thousand times."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above the silent heights
Standing in the woods a house;
So lonely was it to see
There over the forest beyond.
A girl sat there
In the quiet of the evening,
Stir every fibre spinning
To her wedding dress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereto I go and look
In field and forest and valley,
From the mountain up to the meadow;
She was a very beautiful, high woman,
I greet you a thousand times.
In my garden find I
Many flowers, fair and fine,
I may well wind up a hundred crows
And a thousand thoughts bind me
And greetings with me.
I may not grant you any,
She is too high and fair
They must all fade,
The love is infinite
Forever will stay in my heart.
I seem a little happier
And go on and on,
And if my heart breaks,
I go on and on singing
And soon find my grave.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linde smoke in the treetops,
Bird flying from her,
Brone from the still mountains,
Says where my home lies?
Today in dreams I saw her again,
And, from all the mountains,
Of such greetings to me,
That I started to cry.
Ah! here on the fremd Gipfels:
People, fountains, rock and tree -
All is for me like a dream!
Munter birds in the treetops,
You angel there in the valley,
Comes greeting me from the unknown peaks
My home a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whereto I go and look
In field and forest and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
From the mountain up to the blue:
I would greet you a thousand times.
In my garden find I
A lot of flowers fair and fine;
Many crowns have I thus winded,
And a thousand thoughts bind me
And greetings with me.
I may not give you any more
You are too high and fair
They must fade too soon
The love without its equal
Forever will stay in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I would speak in the woods,
In the woods it murmurs softly,
With her starry coat
The night covers me there,
There come the little brooks gone,
If I've yet slept?
I sleep not, I hear still long
To the nightingales,
When the treetops sway over me,
It’s ringing all night
These are the thoughts within my heart
Sing when no one is awake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read deep within you,
I dare to boast of this,
What a spell creature
speaks from your voice!
So many words can reach
Into our ears without a plan
And while they sigh,
Is all done!
But only from afar
Your voice reaches to me,
I love him so much
I forget him so hard.
I bebe then, gleaming
Of the glowing embers:
My heart and thy voice
They are all too good!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I raffle up in the night, in night
And felt like a prisoner
I left the streets guarded by the watchman,
Transformed softly
In the night, in the day,
The gate with its gotic knife.
The Mühlbach murmured through the barren shaft,
I leaned over the bridge
Deep under me I took the waves away,
The walls so gently
In the night, in the day,
But there was not a backward.
It turned up, unfolded unzähled
Melodic change of stars,
With them the moon in peaceful splendour,
They fluttered gently
In the night, in the day,
Through the deceptive distance.
I looked up to the night, to night
And looked down again;
O woe, how have you spent the days,
Now quietly, gently
In the night, in the day,
In my throbbing heart the regret!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I crawl around
Blessed and mute,
You ask, oh question
Mine not, why?
What shakes my heart
So many sorrows!
And could ever
To be dark?
The tree is dead,
The scent vanishes,
The leaves lie
So yellow in bed,
It’s a thunderstorm
Come with might
And could ever
To be dark?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stream that ran beside me where is it now?
The bird whose song I listened where is he now?
Where is the rose that the friend lay on her heart,
And that kiss that tempted me where is he now?
And the one person I've been and long since
I exchanged another with him, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say I was betraying you,
Were promised high and strong
I know you loved me,
You love no more alone.
Your beautiful eye was burning,
The kisses were burning very,
You loved me and believe me
You love no more alone.
I count not on new,
A glorious return;
Show only that you loved
And love me no more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has been lying
Sorrow is burdenful,
Betrayed, oh! defrauded
All's about me now!
The bright drops are flowing
The cheek always bows down,
Let go, let go to knock,
Let go, my heart, let go!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is broken, you love me not!
You would let me know you love me not.
Though I fled to you in my fleeces,
And love beflies, you love me not!
You spoke it, you said it in words,
With all my well-known deceit, you love me not.
So shall I be the stars, so shall my moon
To miss the sun? you love me not!
What flowers bloom for me, what blooms for the jasmine,
What are the scars blooming? you love me not!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eyes are dim, my mouth is mute,
You mean to talk to me, so be it!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is sore,
And what you wish is a promise.
My hair is grey, my heart is wound,
You are so young and so healthy!
You hate to speak to me and make it so hard.
I look so at you and trembles so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I saw him,
I believe myself blind;
Where I look only to see
I see him alone;
As in waking dreams
His image creeps before me,
Breathes from the deepest darkness,
Lighter only upwards.
Only is light and pale
All around me,
After the sister's games
I have ceased to beget
Instead would rather cry,
Still in my little chamber;
Since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the lordliest of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright minds and steady courage.
Just like there in the blue of the sea,
Bright and fair, that star
So he in my heaven,
Bright and holy, great and distant.
Wandle, wander your ways;
Just look at thy shine
Only with delicacy behold him,
Blissfully be sad.
Do not hear my quiet prayers,
To your bliss only grows;
Thou mayst not know me from the other side,
High star of honour!
Only the sweetest of all
May be blessed thy choice
And I want to bless the high,
A thousand times.
Will then be happy and weep,
Silly, silly am I then;
If it break my heart,
Bride, oh heart, what is the reason?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't believe it
A dream has stirred me;
How would he have if he had lived among all
Raising my arms and blessing me?
It seemed to me that he had spoken:
"I am yours forever and ever"—
It was me—I still dream
It never can be that way.
O let me die in dreams,
fluttered upon his breast,
Slay the blissful death upon me
In tears of infinite desire.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring upon my finger
My ringlet of gold,
I press you on my lips,
Thee with my heartfelt love.
I had dreamt of him,
Of childhood peaceful dreams,
I found myself alone, lost
In the öden, infinite space.
You ring upon my finger
Thou hast only then enlightened me,
Hast thou opened my eyes
Of life's infinite, deep value.
I shall serve him, live to him
To belong to him completely,
Give yourself me and find
Teach me in his splendour.
You ring upon my finger
My ringlet of gold,
I press you on my lips,
Thee with my heartfelt love.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, ye sisters,
Sweetly charming me,
Is the name of the fortunate today,
Winded businessly
About me round the brow
Nor the blooming myrte-garden.
When I was fulfilled,
Of joyful heart,
Only lay in the arms of my lover,
Yet still he cried,
longing in my heart,
Exculted for the day.
Help me, ye sisters,
Help me deceive
A foolish fear,
That I, with clear
The eye that welcomes him,
Him, the source of joy.
Come, my lover,
You appeared to me
Do you give me, sun, your light?
Let me in worship,
Let me live in mercy
Let me apologize to the lord my.
Strew to him, sisters,
Strew him flowers,
Bring him a burst of roses,
But you, sisters,
I greet with sadness
Departing joyfully from your array.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
I shudder with wonder
You cannot grasp it
How I can weep;
Let the burning pearls
Ungewohnte dwellings
Joyfully bright tremble
Into my eye!
How fearful is my bosom,
How blissful!
I could only say with words
How I shall say it;
Come and see thy face
Here upon my breast,
Will whisper to your ears
All my desire.
Do you now know the tears
That I can cry,
You won't see them,
You beloved man?
Stay on my heart,
Take his blow,
That I hold faster and stronger
May only press you.
Here upon my bed
The boat has room,
Where it lies still
Of my dearest dream;
Tomorrow will come,
Where dreams wake,
And, therefore, your image
Smiles to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
You are my joy, I am your desire.
Happiness is love, love is bliss,
I have said it and I will not take it back.
Have ever loved me more than mine own,
I am blessed but now.
Only the swift, only the loving
The child to whom she feeds the food;
Only a mother alone knows
What is love and be happy.
O, how do I blame the man
The mother's joy cannot feel!
You better, lieber angel, you
You look at me and smile too!
On my heart, on my breast,
You are my joy, I am your desire.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thou hast done my first pain to me,
But he did come.
You sleep, you harder, unfortunate man,
The sleep of death.
The leaves flicker before them,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
No longer alive.
I return quietly to my inn,
The veil falls,
There have I thee and my lost happiness
You are my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the myrtle and the bride-mesh,
The gardener's daughter, the rosy maiden
Step into the wings of the lion; he lies
To guide the master to his feet before him.
The brute, wild and unconfident before,
Tread humbly and sternly to your Herrin;
The Virgin, tender and wondrous,
Love touches him gently and weeps at the same:
"How were days when they were no more,
Trepidation, like child and child,
And loved us and loved each other;
The days of childhood are far away.
"You shaked powerfully before we have heard it,
Your mighty head hath wooed the king;
I grew, you see it: I am
The child no longer with childish senses.
"If I were the child and stayed with you,
My strong, enthusiastic, courageous animal;
But I must follow, they did it for me,
Out into the stranger to the unknown man.
"It fell on him that I was beautiful,
I've been liberated, it's now over:
The dragon in hair, my dear friend,
And not the look of tears be bright.
"Will you understand me perfectly? Look griefily at me,
I am sure you are resting calm too;
There I see him come, to whom I must follow
So I give you my last kiss, my friend."
And as he touches the lip of the girl
There people have sensed the prison trembling,
And as he gazes upon the prisoner's face,
Was devastated by the fearful bride.
He turns to the door of the prison to watch,
He swings his sword, he whistles with might;
She whispering, gebieting and threatening
Go out; he wehrt the way in anger.
And there, in the hearths of woe, surges anew.
The knight calls, "Give your weapons to me;
I shot him down, I'll meet him well."
The insatiable humming of anger.
The unfortunate dare to approach the door,
Then he falls transformed into his master:
The beautiful form, a terrible deceit,
Lie blut-fallen entstelled in the dust.
And how he poured the precious blood
He lays upon his body with fierce courage,
He lies so lost in sorrow and pain,
Until the bullet strikes him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The heavens are vapour and blue,
The reed brings flowers to the view.
On the window-pane a flickering field.
A young man stands looking at him.
And even behind the flowers blooms
A blue, a smiling pair of eyes.
March-silk like that which has never been seen.
The reed is pressed gently away.
ice-flowers begin to melting
And God bless the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mother bids the child adieu and watches
Excited on the slumbering little ones.
He sleeps on the wheel so gently and sad.
An angel must appear to her.
She kiss him and hearth him, she can hardly stand.
forget the earthly pains
She waves into the future her hope-dream.
So mothers dream in their hearts.
The raven will still be with his swiftness
Flows outside at my window the way:
Your angel, your angel shall be ours!
The robber serves us to eat!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the drums are pressed to the beat;
How far the Tower! the Road how long!
O would he be at peace and all be gone!
I think it breaks my heart.
I have loved him all my life,
Only him who now is given death.
When the bells are ringing,
To this I am commanded.
He turned to the last time
In the glorious sun of God,—
Now they bind him to their own,—
God grant you eternal rest.
Were then newly planted,
Seven bullets have passed by;
They trembling all for sorrow and pain—
But I met him right in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the town there is much of the celebration,
They hold their wedding with dancing and play,
The joyful wine blinks so red
The bride is only the bridegroom of death.
Yes, dead for the one who does not forget,
Who is not a bridegroom at the wedding;
There he stands among the guest's crown,
And strokes the drum lightly enough!
He strokes the drum, his hair grasped,
The strings are singing loud and clear
He presses them to his heart and does not care
Whether it breaks into a thousand pieces.
It's a terrible thing when someone dies so,
When young his heart is still awaiting joy;
I do not longer want to see it!
That would turn my head spinning.—
Whose call is to show your fingers on me?
O God—serve us sufficiently
That none can overtake the deceit;
I am a musician poor.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I saw him,
I believe myself blind;
Where I look only to see
I see him alone;
As in waking dreams
His image creeps before me,
Breathes from the deepest darkness,
Lighter only upwards.
Only is light and pale
All around me,
After the sister's games
I have ceased to beget
Instead would rather cry,
Still in my little chamber;
Since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the lordliest of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright minds and steady courage.
Just like there in the blue of the sea,
Bright and fair, that star
So he in my heaven,
Bright and holy, great and distant.
Wandle, wander your ways;
Just look at thy shine
Only with delicacy behold him,
Blissfully be sad.
Do not hear my quiet prayers,
To your bliss only grows;
Thou mayst not know me from the other side,
High star of honour!
Only the sweetest of all
May be blessed thy choice
And I want to bless the high,
A thousand times.
Will then be happy and weep,
Silly, silly am I then;
If it break my heart,
Bride, oh heart, what is the reason?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't believe it
A dream has stirred me;
How would he have if he had lived among all
Raising my arms and blessing me?
It seemed to me that he had spoken:
"I am yours forever and ever"—
It was me—I still dream
It never can be that way.
O let me die in dreams,
fluttered upon his breast,
Slay the blissful death upon me
In tears of infinite desire.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring upon my finger
My ringlet of gold,
I press you on my lips,
Thee with my heartfelt love.
I had dreamt of him,
Of childhood peaceful dreams,
I found myself alone, lost
In the öden, infinite space.
You ring upon my finger
Thou hast only then enlightened me,
Hast thou opened my eyes
Of life's infinite, deep value.
I shall serve him, live to him
To belong to him completely,
Give yourself me and find
Teach me in his splendour.
You ring upon my finger
My ringlet of gold,
I press you on my lips,
Thee with my heartfelt love.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, ye sisters,
Sweetly charming me,
Is the name of the fortunate today,
Winded businessly
About me round the brow
Nor the blooming myrte-garden.
When I was fulfilled,
Of joyful heart,
Only lay in the arms of my lover,
Yet still he cried,
longing in my heart,
Exculted for the day.
Help me, ye sisters,
Help me deceive
A foolish fear,
That I, with clear
The eye that welcomes him,
Him, the source of joy.
Come, my lover,
You appeared to me
Do you give me, sun, your light?
Let me in worship,
Let me live in mercy
Let me apologize to the lord my.
Strew to him, sisters,
Strew him flowers,
Bring him a burst of roses,
But you, sisters,
I greet with sadness
Departing joyfully from your array.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
I shudder with wonder
You cannot grasp it
How I can weep;
Let the burning pearls
Ungewohnte dwellings
Joyfully bright tremble
Into my eye!
How fearful is my bosom,
How blissful!
I could only say with words
How I shall say it;
Come and see thy face
Here upon my breast,
Will whisper to your ears
All my desire.
Do you now know the tears
That I can cry,
You won't see them,
You beloved man?
Stay on my heart,
Take his blow,
That I hold faster and stronger
May only press you.
Here upon my bed
The boat has room,
Where it lies still
Of my dearest dream;
Tomorrow will come,
Where dreams wake,
And, therefore, your image
Smiles to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
You are my joy, I am your desire.
Happiness is love, love is bliss,
I have said it and I will not take it back.
Have ever loved me more than mine own,
I am blessed but now.
Only the swift, only the loving
The child to whom she feeds the food;
Only a mother alone knows
What is love and be happy.
O, how do I blame the man
The mother's joy cannot feel!
You better, lieber angel, you
You look at me and smile too!
On my heart, on my breast,
You are my joy, I am your desire.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thou hast done my first pain to me,
But he did come.
You sleep, you harder, unfortunate man,
The sleep of death.
The leaves flicker before them,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
No longer alive.
I return quietly to my inn,
The veil falls,
There have I thee and my lost happiness
You are my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dreaming of my own days,
That are now far away,
daughter of my daughter,
You sweet child,
Take, before the weary
Decks the bedcloth,
Come freshly into life
My blessing.
You see me grey with hair
Abated and pale.
I was like you,
Young and wondrous,
Love, as you love me,
Beauteous as thou, and bride,
And you too will alter,
Just as I lie buried.
Let the time fly in its flight
Going on and on,
Just beständigly true
Of your bosom's guard;
I once spoke of it,
I will not take it back:
Happiness is only love,
Love is only bliss.
Than I whom I loved
Laid in the grave,
Have I my love
Treading in me deeply:
My heart was broken,
The courage that gave me strength,
And the ashes of old age
Holds the holy glow.
Take, before the weary
Decks the bedcloth,
Come freshly into life
My blessing is this:
Must break your heart,
Keep fast your courage
Be the pain of love
Then is your greatest good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we kissed one night, O girls,
No one has ever looked at us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We have hurled the stars.
There is a star fallen
Who hath tormented the sea,
There has the sea taken it to the wheel,
The captain said to the shipwreck.
There sang the same boatman
It was brought to his dearest.
Now we sing it on streets and markets
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Were often in the circle of my lovers
In the perfumed grass,
And singed to me a song
And everything was pretty and well.
I loved to be alone,
And had no sense of humour
But I came again to sing
All was well again.
And many things I know
I prayed in my silent woe,
But I came to sing again,
And all was well again.
Therefore thou mayst not long moan,
What brings me nearer to you,
Freshly, freshly sung!
And everything will be good again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well have I wandered away in sad hour,
Love cried so much
My feet are weak and my shoulders sore,
The heart that is so hard to bear.
What are ye birds singing in the dawn?
You know not how to split!
It doesn't press you with sorrows and shoes;
Birds, you are well.
