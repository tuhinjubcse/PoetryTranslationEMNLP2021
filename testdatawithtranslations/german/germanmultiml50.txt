I think yours,
When the sun shines on me
Beaming from the sea;
I think yours,
when the moon flickers
Painting in Sources.
I see you,
when on the far way
The dust rises,
In the deep night,
when on the narrow bridge
The transformer is shaking.
I hear you,
when there is a dull noise
The wave rises.
In silent sharks I often go to listen,
When everything is silent.
I am with you,
you are still so far away,
You are close to me!
The sun is setting,
soon the stars will shine on me.
Oh, would you be there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
bundles the city and the park
about the reason where the summer is burned
there are sails of smoke.
we sacrifice first your chastity, dearest
and get the gift of the language for it
exhausted and dissolved lie the bodies
in the shadow of the talk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh food, new blood
I suck out of the free world:
How is nature so kind and good,
That keeps me on my chest!
The wave weighs our boat
Up in a row,
And mountains, cloudy in the sky,
Meet Our Run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye, my eye, what are you sinking into?
Gold dreams, will you come back?
Way, you dream! so gold you are:
Here is also love and life.
A thousand floating stars flash on the wave,
Soft mist drinking ring the towering distance;
Morning winds whirl The shaded bay,
And in the lake the ripening fruit reflects itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supplementary longing then takes place
when longing adds the one
which was also lacking in fulfilment, if it existed.
as in the evening at the window in mixed light
the unknown is linked to the absolute
And the far is dissolved into the wide. I cry:
I don't want anything from what I already know!
otherwise there are cold loneliness
as there is cold chicken in paris restaurants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the Crucified, this frog lay
Plate rolled on the hot asphalt
The country road. Open mouths
Bow down to heaven, scorched by the sun,
What looked like a shoe sole from afar –
An amphibious from ancient Earth,
Under the wheels came in the jump.
No resurrection than in the larvae
The flies that will hatch tomorrow.
What is the opening through which the dream escapes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You feel a sense of emptiness
Something is gnawing at your insides
Filled with despair, you look around you
How would you like to be another
Put yourself in our hands
We will transform you
without hesitation
in their opposite
They Trie
We dry you out
They are withered
We stimulate your juices
They insist on being a man
We change your anatomy
They tend to be gentle
We put you in a frenzy
They shivered outwards
We invert your gaze
You doubt
We satisfy you with certainty
They're scared
We hang you
on your teeth
under the circus dome
They rest in themselves
We will tear you to pieces
You breathe health
We contaminate you
Should in you
as a late consequence
the desire to germinate
to be a man with his contradiction
we put you dialectically in the middle
The magicians and magnetisers of the house
are at your service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of the First Light,
Picture of tenderness in mourning!
Fog swims with silver shower
To your lovely face;
Your silent foot run
Wakes up from locked-in caves
Sadly departed souls,
Me and the birds at night.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hardly in the wall, he was the middle,
speeded up his radius
about the gardens, fields and vineyards
the chicken stalls, the radies and the
chenbeet, became more comprehensive, mondial:
we hung up the hats. we hang up knitted
jackets and frames, hanging raincoats
and shield up until we almost forgot him, whose hard gaze
will still be there when we have long gone out
and city and house and street
disappeared – so steadfastly far above,
so shining over the west and east,
that could be navigated in the dark
after him, and old sailors a consolation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when October hung in the branches,
exhausted lampions, it was time: we
picked quittens, weighted grains of yellow in the kitchen
underwater. apple and pear ripen
to her name, a simple sweet –
Unlike the quince on her tree in the back corner
my alphabet, in the Latin of the garden,
hard and strange in their aroma. we cut,
fourth, gutted the meat (four large hands, two small),
disguised in the steam of the juicer, gave
sugar, heat, effort to something that
raw mouth failed. who could, wanted to understand quitten,
their liquid, in bulky glasses for the
dark days on the shelves
rows, in a cellar of days where they glowed, glow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've sewn diamonds into your skirt so you can buy bread
I put the sleeping animal in the backpack and a glass of jam, but psssst
I rolled your underwear under the sheet, you have to unpack it quickly
I stuffed the papers in this bag at the bottom, that's not it, you know
I've embroidered a little money in the coat, maybe you can
I have grandfather's watch in the vase by the window, they shouldn't stop you
I have put a pen in this envelope and a letter to my uncle, give it to him
I've separated the star from the jacket, so it's better
I burned all the stars, now every night is black
It seems I've given all the advice, now I don't have any more
I sewed diamonds into your skirt hem, but psssst
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I leave this hut,
My dearest stay,
Convert with Covered Steps
Through the barren, dark forest:
Luna breaks through bush and oaks,
Zephyr announces her run,
And the birches scatter with tilts
Give up the sweet incense.
How I feel in the cold
This beautiful summer night!
Oh how quiet it is to feel here,
What makes the soul happy!
Can hardly grasp the delight,
And yet, heaven, I want you
Leave a thousand such nights,
Give my girl one to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, it's the eyes again,
Who once greeted me so sweetly,
And it's the lips again,
Who sweetened my life.
Also the voice is again,
Which I once loved to hear!
Only I'm not myself again,
I returned home changed.
From the white, beautiful arms
Festive and lovingly enclosed,
Now I'm lying on her heart,
Dull senses and threatened.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star falls down
From his sparkling lair,
This is the star of love,
Which I see falling there.
It falls from the apple tree,
The white leaves so much,
There come the necking airs,
And play their game with it.
The swan sings in the pond,
And rows up and down,
And singing ever softer,
He enters the tomb.
It's so quiet and dark,
Broken is the leaf and the flower’,
The star is crushed crackling,
"Swan Song".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swing from all branches
Migrating birds rise,
Sounding far through the air
If you listen to the travel choir,
To the South, South
In the Eternal Flowers.
Your bird sings cheerfully down,
We sing out funny,
When the Lenz comes,
Let's go back,
Back in nest and house,
From the south! But now out!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaded by blooming branches,
Cooled by playing vests,
Lag Rosilis at the creek here
And Hylas beside her.
They sang joke songs to each other,
She threw him with flowers, he again;
She didn't kiss him, he kissed her,
Who knows how long' and how.
Touched by Lenz and love,
Ward seduces Hylas to kiss.
He kissed her, he pressed her
That she cried out for help.
The mother came hurriedly and asked,
What evil did Hylas dare to do here?
The daughter cried out: It has happened,
You can now go back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laziness, finally I have to give you
Also sing a little praise song. –
O how mad he will be to me,
Sing to yourself for dignity!
But, I want to do my best,
After work is good to rest.
Highest good! who only has you,
The Undisturbed Life
Oh! I yawn’ I get dull
Now you may forgive me,
That I can't sing to you;
You are preventing me from doing so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At midnight I went, not exactly gladly,
Little boy, that churchyard
To Father's house, the parish priest; star by star,
But they all shone too beautifully;
At midnight.
If I then further in the width of life
To the beloved she had to, because she moved,
Star and northern light above me in strife,
I went, coming sowed blessings;
At midnight.
Until the last of the full moon Bright
So clearly and clearly drove me into the darkness,
Even the thought willingly, persistent, quick
Slanged about the past as around the future;
At midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to sneak to the doors,
I will stand still and upright;
A pious hand will be rich in food,
And I will go on.
Everyone will seem happy,
When my image appears before him;
He will cry a tear,
And I don't know what he's crying about.
To whom God wills to give righteous favor,
He sends it into the wide world,
To whom he wants to show his miracles
In mountain and forest and stream and field.
The tears lying at home,
Do not revive the dawn,
You only know about weighing children,
Of worry, burden and need for bread.
The streams jumping from the mountains,
The larks whirl high in lust,
What shall I not sing with them
From full throat and fresh chest.
I only let the dear God reign;
The little stream, the lark, wind and field,
And earth’ and heaven wants to preserve,
My Sach has also ordered ‘to the best’.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the lightning red
There come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
Nobody knows me there anymore.
How soon, oh how soon the quiet time comes,
There I also rest, and above me
Screams the beautiful loneliness of the forest,
And nobody knows me here anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Picture Wonderful
Have I in the bottom of my heart,
That looks so fresh and cheerful
I'll be there for you at any time."
My heart sings silently in itself
An old, beautiful song,
That vibrates in the air
And rushes to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's already late, it is already cold,
What are you riding lonely through the forest?
The forest is long, you're alone,
You beautiful bride! I will take you home!
“Great is the deceit and cunning of men,
With pain my heart is broken,
Probably the forest horn errs here and there,
O flee! You don’t know who I am.”
So richly adorned is the horse and the woman,
So beautiful the young body,
Now I know you—God help me!
You are the witch Loreley.
“You know me well—of high stone
Look silently at my castle deep into the Rhine.
It's already late, it is already cold,
Don't ever come out of this forest!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It knows and advises none,
As well as I am, so well!
Oh, if only one knew, just one,
Nobody else should know!
It’s not so quiet outside in the snow,
So silent and secretive are
The stars are not in hell,
As my thoughts are.
I wish I was a bird
And stretch out over the sea,
Well above the sea and further,
Until I was in heaven'!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if heaven had,
The earth kissed silently,
That they are in bloom
You just have to dream about it."
The air went through the fields,
The ears weighed thick,
The forests rustled softly,
The night was so clear.
And my soul stretched
Far from their wings,
Flew through the silent lands,
As if she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The apples are rustling and shivering,
As if made to this Stund’
Around the half-sunk walls
"The Old Gods".
Here behind the myrtle trees
In secretly dawning splendor,
What do you say confusingly, like in dreams,
To me, fantastic night?
All the stars are shining on me
With a burning look of love,
It talks drunk the distance
How of great future happiness!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleeping on the Lauer
Above is the old knight;
Rain showers go cloudy,
And the forest roars through the grid.
Grown beard and hair,
And petrified chest and groin,
He sits many hundred years
Above in the silent cloister.
Outside it is quiet and peaceful,
All have moved into the valley,
Forest birds singing lonely
Into the empty window arch.
A wedding rides down there
On the Rhine in the sunshine,
musicians playing lively,
And the beautiful bride weeping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hear the streams rushing
In the woods back and forth,
In the woods, in the noise
I don't know where I am.
Beating the Nightingales
Here in solitude,
As if they wanted to say something
From the old, beautiful time.
The moonlight flies,
As if I saw beneath me
The castle lies in the valley,
And yet it is so far from here!
As if in the garden
Full of roses white and red,
My dearest waiting for me,
And is still dead for so long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I can sing sometimes,
As if I'm happy,
But secretly tears penetrate,
Then my heart will be free.
It leaves nightingales,
Plays outside spring air,
The longing to hear the song
From her dungeon tomb.
There all hearts are listening,
And everything is delighted,
But no one feels the pain,
In the song the deep sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insulation wants to spread the wings,
The trees tremble terribly,
Clouds pull like heavy dreams—
What does this gray mean?
Have a deer you love before others,
Don't let it graze alone,
Hunters move in the woods and blow,
Voices wander from time to time.
Do you have a friend here,
Do not trust him at this hour,
Friendly well with eye’ and mouth,
He is a warrior in peace.
What goes under today tired,
Rise tomorrow newborn.
Some things are lost at night—
Beware, be awake and lively!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a wedding along the mountain,
I heard the birds strike,
There flashed a lot of riders, the forest horn sounded,
That was a fun hunt!
And anyway I thought it was all over,
The night covers the round;
Only from the mountains still roars the forest
And it frightens me in the bottom of my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the garden through the air
Hear I move migratory birds,
This means spring fragrances,
Below it already begins to bloom.
I like to shout, I want to cry,
It's as if it can't be for me!
Old miracles appear again
Come in with the moonlight.
And the moon, the stars say it,
And in the dream the grove roars
And the nightingales beat it:
She is yours, she is thine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the forests slept,
He began to dig,
Restless in mountain depths
After a treasure he dug.
The angels of God sang
Meanwhile in a quiet night,
As red eyes penetrated
Metals from the shaft.
“And become mine!”, and groan
He rummages and rumbles down!
There fall stones and debris
Over the fool.
Laughter roused wildly
From the fallen tomb,
The Angel's Song Resounded
Sadly in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There were two armoured companions
For the first time from home,
So cheering right into the bright,
Ringing, singing waves
Out of the full spring.
Those who aspired to high things,
They wanted, despite lust and pain,
What right do in the world,
And to whom they passed by,
The laughing senses and heart.
The first who found a darling,
The father-in-law buys the farm and the house;
He soon weighed a little,
And looked out of a secret place
Comfortably out into the field.
To the second sang and lied
The thousand voices in the ground,
enticing’ sirens, and pulled
Into the shimmering waves,
In the waves colored throat.
And as he emerges from the wound,
Then he was tired and old,
His little ship was basically,
It was so quiet in the circle,
And above the water it is cold.
The waves sound and sing
Of spring well above me;
And I see so cheeky companions,
The tears in my eye swell—
Oh, God, lead us lovingly to You!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, comfort of the world, you quiet night!
How do you rise from the mountains,
The airs all sleep,
A sailor only, wandering tired’,
Sings his evening song over the sea
To God's praise in the harbor.
The years go like the clouds
And let me stand here alone,
The world has forgotten me,
Then you came to me wonderfully,
When I hear the noise of the forest here
Sitting Thoughtfully.
O comfort of the world, you silent night!
The day made me so tired,
The wide sea is already dark,
Let me rest from lust and need,
Until the eternal dawn
Sparks through the silent forest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the lightning red
There come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
Nobody knows me there anymore.
How soon, oh how soon the quiet time comes,
There I also rest, and above me
Screams the beautiful loneliness of the forest,
And nobody knows me here anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if heaven had,
The earth kissed silently,
That they are in bloom
You just have to dream about it."
The air went through the fields,
The ears weighed thick,
The forests rustled softly,
The night was so clear.
And my soul stretched
Far from their wings,
Flew through the silent lands,
As if she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welshland, loud and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shiny Au'.
In the night the darling listened
At the window sweet expects,
Wish me and you, both of us,
Secretly a beautiful night.
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welshland, loud and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shiny Au'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Past is the bright day,
From afar comes the sound of the bell;
So time travels all night,
Take some with you who haven’t thought of it.
Where then is the colourful lust,
The friend's comfort and faithful chest,
The sweetest eye candy?
Doesn't anyone want to be happy with me?
Fresh on then, dear nightingale,
You waterfall with bright sound!
We want to praise God united,
Until the bright morning shines!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She probably stood at the window
And pulls her hair sadly,
The hunter was gone,
The hunter was her favorite.
And when the spring came,
The world was covered with blossoms,
Then she took a heart
And went into the green devotion'.
She puts her ear to the lawn,
Hear also the sound of hooves –
These are the deer that graze
On the shady mountain slope.
And in the evening the forests roar,
Only one shot falls from a distance,
There she stands silently listening:
“That was my dearest greeting!”
And springs sprang up from the rock,
Then the birds fled into the valley.
“And where you meet him, you companions,
Oh, greet him a thousand times!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above silent heights
Standing in the forest a house;
It was so lonely to see,
There they cross the forest.
A girl sat in it
At a quiet evening,
Do silky threads spinning
To her wedding dress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where I go and look,
In field and forest and valley,
From the mountain down into the meadow;
A lot of beautiful, tall woman,
I greet you a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Many’ flowers, beautiful and fine,
A lot of wreaths probably wind from it I
And a thousand thoughts I bind
And greetings with it.
I can't give her any,
She is too tall and beautiful,
They must all fade,
Love only incomparable
Stay forever in the heart.
I seem to be happy things
And go up and down,
And if the heart breaks,
I dig on and sing,
And soon dig me my grave.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linden noise in the apples,
Birds flying far away from you,
Bronns from the silent peaks,
Tells me where my home is?
Today in my dream I saw her again,
And from all the mountains went
Such greetings to me,
That I started crying.
Ah! here on the foreign summits:
People, springs, rock and tree -
Everything is like a dream to me!
Muntre birds in the apples,
Your companions there in the valley,
Greet me from the strange summits
My homeland a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where I go and look,
In field and forest and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
From the mountain up far into the blue:
I greet you a thousand times.
In my garden I find
A lot of flowers beautiful and fine;
A lot of wreaths probably d’raus wind’ ich,
And a thousand thoughts I bind,
And greetings with that.
I can't give you one,
You're too tall and beautiful,
They must fade too soon,
Love without equals
Stay in the heart forever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I would lie in the woods,
In the woods it sounds so good,
With her star coat
Cover me there the night,
Then come the streams gone,
Do I already sleep?
I don’t sleep, I listen for a long time
To the nightingales,
When the tops of the clouds sway over me,
It's ringing all night,
These are the thoughts in the heart,
They sing when no one is watching.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read deep in you,
Do not hide this from me,
What a magical being
Speak out of your voice!
So many words penetrate
To our ears without a plan
And while they glow,
It's all over!
But pushes even from a distance
Your tone comes to me,
I am so glad to hear him,
I forgot him so badly.
I'm shaking then, I slipped
From allzurascher Glut:
My heart and your voice
Understand each other too well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I get up at night, in the night
And felt drawn again,
I left the streets guarded by guards,
Transformed sapphire
At night, at night
The gate with the Gothic arch.
The Mühlbach screeched through rocky shaft,
I leaned over the bridge,
Deep beneath me I took care of the waves,
The walls were so juicy
At night, at night
But there was no turning back.
It turned upside down, innumerable ignited
Melodic change of the stars,
With them the moon in calm glory,
They sparkled juicy
At night, at night
By deceptively remote distance.
I looked up at night, in the night
And looked down again;
O woe, how have you spent the days,
Now you're quiet sacht,
At night, at night
Repentance in a throbbing heart!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm creeping around
Sad and silent,
You ask, o ask
Not me, why?
The heart is shaking
So many pains!
And can I ever
To be too gloomy?
The tree withers,
The fragrance passes,
The leaves lie
So yellow in the bed,
It's a thunderstorm
In with power,
And can I ever
To be too gloomy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stream that sounded next to me, where is it now?
The bird whose song I heard, where is he now?
Where is the rose that the friend wore at heart,
And that kiss that intoxicated me, where is it now?
And that man, who I have been, and whom I long ago
With another I exchanged, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say I'm deceiving myself,
Sworn it high and high,
I know you loved,
Only you don't love anymore!
Your beautiful eye burned,
The kisses burned very,
You loved me, admit it,
Only you don't love anymore!
I don't count on new,
Faithful return;
Just pretend that you loved,
And don't love me anymore!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has lied,
The worry weighs heavily,
Cheated, oh! cheated
Everything has me around!
Light drops flow
The cheek always down,
Let go, let go of knocking,
Let go, my heart, let go!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is torn, you don't love me!
You let me know, you don't love me!
Though I appeared to you pleading and advocating,
And lovingly, you don't love me!
You have spoken it, said it in words,
Of course, you don't love me!
So shall I make the stars, and the moon,
Miss the sun? you don't love me!
What does the rose bloom for me, what blooms the jasmine,
What are the daffodils blooming? you don't love me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eye is dull, my mouth is silent,
You call me talking, that's why!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is red,
And what you wish for is a commandment.
My hair is grey, my heart is sore,
You are so young and so healthy!
You call me talking and make it so hard for me.
I look at you and tremble so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I saw him,
I believe to be blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
As in the awake dreams
Is his image floating before me,
Dive from deepest darkness,
Brighter only upwards.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
I no longer desire,
Would rather cry,
Silent in the closet;
Since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Holde lips, clear eye,
Bright sense and firm courage.
Just like there in blue depth,
Bright and glorious, that star,
So he in my heaven,
Bright and magnificent, high and far.
Change, change your ways;
Just look at your appearance,
Only look at him in humility,
Just be happy and sad!
Do not hear my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to your happiness;
Don't you know me, young maid,
High star of glory!
Only the most worthy of all
May your choice please,
And I will bless the High,
Thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and cry,
Blessed, then blessed am I;
Should my heart break,
Break, O heart, what is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can’t believe it,
A dream has touched me;
How could he have been among all
Raises me poor and makes me happy?
That’s it for me, he said:
“I am yours forever”—
It was—I still dream,
It can never be that way.
O let me die in a dream,
Weighing on his chest,
Blessed death to sip me
In tears of infinite lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringlet,
I squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
I had dreamed of him,
Childhood peacefully beautiful dream,
I found myself alone, lost
In a barren, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
Since you taught me first,
You opened my eyes
The infinite, deep value of life.
I will serve him, live for him
To Him belong all,
To give myself and find
Enlightens me in its splendour.
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringlet,
I squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Friendly decorate me,
The Happy One serves me today,
Windet Busy
Me around the Tail
Still the blooming myrtle ornament.
When I am satisfied,
With a joyful heart,
Otherwise the beloved lay in his arms,
Still he cried,
Desire in the heart,
Impatient today.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me escape
A foolish apprehension,
That I am using clear
Eye receive him,
Him, the source of joy.
Be, my beloved,
You appeared to me,
Will you give me your light, sun?
Let me in devotion,
Let me in humility,
Let me bow my head to the Lord.
Scatter to him, sisters,
Scatters flowers to him,
Bring him bowing roses,
But to you, sisters,
Greetings with sorrow,
Joyfully separating from your crowd.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
Wondering at me,
Can't you understand,
How I can cry;
Leave the damp pearls
Unfamiliar ornament
Joyfully shivering brightly
In the eye of me!
How so frightened my bust,
How wonderful!
If I only knew in words,
How shall I say it;
Come and bury your face
Here on my chest,
Will whisper in your ear
All my pleasure.
Do you know the tears,
Which I can cry,
Shouldn't you see them,
You beloved man?
Stay with my heart,
Feel its blow,
That I'm firmer and stronger
Just like to push you.
Here at my bed
Has the cradle room,
Where they hide silently
My dear dream;
The morning will come,
Where the dream awakens,
And from this your portrait
He laughs at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my chest,
You my delight, you my lust!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and don't take it back.
I have overestimated myself,
I am overjoyed but now.
Only the one who's nursing, only the ones who love
The child to whom she feeds;
Only one mother knows alone,
What it means to love and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man,
The mother's happiness can't feel!
Dear, dear angel, you
You look at me and smile!
On my heart, on my chest,
You my delight, you my lust!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you've done me the first pain,
But he did.
You sleep, you hard, merciless man,
The Sleep of Death.
It looks at the reliability in front of it,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
Not alive anymore.
I withdraw silently into my innres,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
You my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decorated with myrtle and bridal smoothness,
The Guard's Daughter, the Pink Maid
Enters the lion's kennel; he lies
The mistress at his feet, in front of which he is huddled.
The mighty, wild and unbridled before,
Look up to your mistress with piety and understanding;
The Virgin, delicate and fragrant,
Love him gently and cry at the same time:
“How were in days that are no more,
Even faithful played, like child and child,
And loved us, and delighted in us;
The days of childhood, they are far away from us.
“You shook powerfully, eh’ we believed,
Your royal head girded with feathers;
I grew up, you see it: I am
The child no longer with a childish sense.
“Oh, if I were still the child and stayed with you,
My strong, faithful, my righteous beast;
But I must follow, they did it to me,
Out into the stranger's strange man.
“It occurred to him that I was beautiful,
I was released, it's over now:
The wreath in the hair, my good friend,
And before tears do not look brighter.
“Do you understand me completely? Look at it grimly,
I am ready, be still also thou;
There I see him coming, whom I must follow,
So, my friend, I will give you the last kiss!”
And as the girl's lips touched him,
There one felt the kennel tremble,
And as he looks at the young man in the kennel,
Captures horror of the frightened bride.
He stands at the door of the kennel to watch,
He swings his tail, he roars with power;
She desires praying, commanding and threatening
Out; he defends the exit in anger.
And outside there is a confused scream.
The young man cries out: “Bring weapons;
I shot him down, I met him well!”
The irritated man screams in shameful rage.
The wicked dares to approach the door,
Then he turns on the mistress:
The beautiful figure, a terrible robbery,
Lying bloody torn distorted in the dust.
And as he shed the precious blood,
He lays down with dark courage,
He lies so drowned in sorrow and pain,
Until fatally the bullet hits him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky is clear and blue,
The mature plant displays flowers.
At the window there is a shimmering floral.
A young man stands in front of him, looking at him.
And behind the flowers is still blooming
A blue, smiling pair of eyes.
March violets, like those not yet seen.
The grapes are smoked and cut into pieces.
Ice flowers begin to melt,
And may God have mercy on the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mother prays heartily and looks
Delighted at the slumbering little ones.
He rests in the cradle so gently and confidently.
He must appear to her as an angel.
She kisses him and cuddles him, she hardly holds herself.
Forgetting the earthly pains,
Her dream of hope floats into the future.
This is how mothers dream in their hearts.
The raven, however, will be with the siblings
Round the way outside at the window:
Your angel, your angel will be ours!
The robber serves us for food!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It goes with muted drum sound;
How far still the place! the way how long!
O would he be at peace and everything over!
I think it's breaking my heart.
I only loved him in the world,
Only him, to whom death is now given.
In sounding games is paraded,
I am also in charge of this.
Now he looks up for the last time
In God's sun joyful ray,—
Now they close their eyes to him,—
May God give you eternal rest!
Nine have then laid down well,
Eight bullets have passed;
They all tremble with grief and pain—
But I, I met him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the town there is a lot of joy,
Since they hold wedding with dance and with game,
To the happy the wine flashes so red,
The bride only resembles the tempered death.
Yes, dead for the one she doesn't forget,
But he who is not a bridegroom at the feast;
There he stands among the guests in the jug,
And stroke the violin funny enough!
He strokes the violin, his hair is gray,
The strings vibrate yellow and loud,
He presses them to the heart and doesn't care,
Whether it also breaks into a thousand pieces.
It's awful when one dies like that,
When a young man's heart is still searching for joy;
I like it and don't want to see it anymore!
That would make my head spin spinning.—
Who tells you to point your fingers at me?
O God—keep us merciful,
That no one is overcome by madness;
I'm a poor musician myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I saw him,
I believe to be blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
As in the awake dreams
Is his image floating before me,
Dive from deepest darkness,
Brighter only upwards.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
I no longer desire,
Would rather cry,
Silent in the closet;
Since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Holde lips, clear eye,
Bright sense and firm courage.
Just like there in blue depth,
Bright and glorious, that star,
So he in my heaven,
Bright and magnificent, high and far.
Change, change your ways;
Just look at your appearance,
Only look at him in humility,
Just be happy and sad!
Do not hear my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to your happiness;
Don't you know me, young maid,
High star of glory!
Only the most worthy of all
May your choice please,
And I will bless the High,
Thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and cry,
Blessed, then blessed am I;
Should my heart break,
Break, O heart, what is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can’t believe it,
A dream has touched me;
How could he have been among all
Raises me poor and makes me happy?
That’s it for me, he said:
“I am yours forever”—
It was—I still dream,
It can never be that way.
O let me die in a dream,
Weighing on his chest,
Blessed death to sip me
In tears of infinite lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringlet,
I squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
I had dreamed of him,
Childhood peacefully beautiful dream,
I found myself alone, lost
In a barren, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
Since you taught me first,
You opened my eyes
The infinite, deep value of life.
I will serve him, live for him
To Him belong all,
To give myself and find
Enlightens me in its splendour.
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringlet,
I squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Friendly decorate me,
The Happy One serves me today,
Windet Busy
Me around the Tail
Still the blooming myrtle ornament.
When I am satisfied,
With a joyful heart,
Otherwise the beloved lay in his arms,
Still he cried,
Desire in the heart,
Impatient today.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me escape
A foolish apprehension,
That I am using clear
Eye receive him,
Him, the source of joy.
Be, my beloved,
You appeared to me,
Will you give me your light, sun?
Let me in devotion,
Let me in humility,
Let me bow my head to the Lord.
Scatter to him, sisters,
Scatters flowers to him,
Bring him bowing roses,
But to you, sisters,
Greetings with sorrow,
Joyfully separating from your crowd.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
Wondering at me,
Can't you understand,
How I can cry;
Leave the damp pearls
Unfamiliar ornament
Joyfully shivering brightly
In the eye of me!
How so frightened my bust,
How wonderful!
If I only knew in words,
How shall I say it;
Come and bury your face
Here on my chest,
Will whisper in your ear
All my pleasure.
Do you know the tears,
Which I can cry,
Shouldn't you see them,
You beloved man?
Stay with my heart,
Feel its blow,
That I'm firmer and stronger
Just like to push you.
Here at my bed
Has the cradle room,
Where they hide silently
My dear dream;
The morning will come,
Where the dream awakens,
And from this your portrait
He laughs at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my chest,
You my delight, you my lust!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and don't take it back.
I have overestimated myself,
I am overjoyed but now.
Only the one who's nursing, only the ones who love
The child to whom she feeds;
Only one mother knows alone,
What it means to love and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man,
The mother's happiness can't feel!
Dear, dear angel, you
You look at me and smile!
On my heart, on my chest,
You my delight, you my lust!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you've done me the first pain,
But he did.
You sleep, you hard, merciless man,
The Sleep of Death.
It looks at the reliability in front of it,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
Not alive anymore.
I withdraw silently into my innres,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
You my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream of your own days,
Those who are now far away,
Daughter of my daughter,
You my sweet child,
Take Before the Tired
Covers the shroud,
Take to fresh life
My Blessing.
See me grey with hair,
Abandoned and bleached.
I've been like you
Young and fragrant,
Love as you love,
Ward, like you, also bride,
And you too will grow old,
Just like I greyed out.
Let time fly
Moving on and on,
Only consistently true
Hort of your bosom;
Once I said it,
I won’t take it back:
Happiness is only love,
Love is only happiness.
When I, whom I loved,
laid in the grave,
Do I have my love
Loyally cherished in me:
Was my heart broken,
I still had the courage,
And the ashes of old age
Maintains the healthy embers.
Take Before the Tired
Covers the shroud,
Take to fresh life
My Blessing:
Must your heart break,
Hold fast your courage,
Be the pain of love
Then your highest good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we kissed each other at night, oh girl,
No one looked at us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We have dared the stars.
A star has fallen,
He has accused us of the sea,
Since the sea has it to the rudder,
The rudder told the sailor.
The same sailor sang
It to his loved ones before.
Now singing on streets and markets
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have’ often in the circle of the loved ones
Resting in fragrant grass,
And sang me a little song,
And everything was nice and good.
Lonely I've also hardened myself
And had no sense and courage
But I came to sing again
Everything was also good again.
And some of what I'm experiencing,
I whispered in silent Wuth,
But I came to sing again,
Everything was also good again.
Therefore do not lament for long,
Whatever hurts you,
Just fresh, just freshly sung!
And everything will be fine again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I'll wander out in a sad state,
Love cried so much,
My foot is paralyzed, my shoulder hurts,
The heart, it's so hard for me.
What do you sing, you birds, in the morning light?
You don't know how to divorce!
You are not burdened with worries and shoes;
You birds, you are doing well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
