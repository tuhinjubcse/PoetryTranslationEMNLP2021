I think yours,
when the sun shines
From the sea;
I think yours,
when the moon grows brighter
In Quellen malt.
I see you,
when on the far way
The dust is falling,
Deep in the night,
when on the narrow slope
Der Wandrer bebt.
I can hear you,
when there is a dull noise
The wave is rising.
In the still shark I often go to listen,
If everything remains silent.
I'm with you,
you are still so far away,
You're close!
The sun sinks,
I'll soon see the stars.
O wärst du da!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
bundles the city and in the park
about the reason, where the summer is burnt
are the sails of the rauchs.
we sacrifice first your keuschheit, beloved
and receive the delivery of the language for
exhausted and dissolved lie the bodies
im schatten der rede
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh food, new blood
I suck from the free world:
Wie ist Natur so hold und gut,
She's the one holding me up!
The wave weighs our yaw
Up on the rudder,
And mountains, cloudy in the sky,
Ending our run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aug, my eye, what are you falling?
Goldne Träume, kommt ihr wieder?
You're gone, you dream!
Hier auch Lieb und Leben ist.
The wave is flooded with thousands of stars,
Soft fog drinks Rings the rushing distance;
The morning wind blows over the shaded bay,
And in the lake, He reflects the ripe fruit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supplementary longing takes place
when desire adds that desire
was also lacking in fulfillment, if it were to exist.
like at night by the window in the mixed light
the unknown joins with the absolute
and the distant is dissolved into the far. I cry:
I don't want anything from what I already know!
otherwise there are cold loneliness
as in paris restaurants there is cold hooting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the escaped frog,
Hard-rolled on the hot asphalt
Off the highway.
Bog sich zum Himmel, von Sonne gedörrt,
Was von fern einer Schuhsohle glich –
An amphibium from ancient Earth,
Gettin' under the wheels in a splash.
No resurrection as in the larvae
The flies that will flee tomorrow.
What is the opening of the dream?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You feel a feeling of emptiness
Something gnaws at your inside
Filled with envy, you look around
How would you like to be different?
Get in our Hand
We will transform you
without hesitation
on the contrary
They were flying
We'll dry you out
They're rotten
We stimulate your juices
You insist on being a man
We're changing your anatomy
They tend to be gentle
We'll put you in a good mood.
They're sneaking out
Wir invertieren Ihren Blick
They doubt
We satisfy you with certainty
You're scared
We'll hang you
at your teeth
under the circus dome
They rest in themselves
We'll tear you apart
You breathe health
We're contaminating you
Should in you
as late follow-up
der Wunsch aufkeimen
a person with his contradiction
Let's get you in the middle dialect
The magicians and magnetists of the house
are at your service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of the first light,
Bild der Zärtlichkeit in Trauer!
Nebula swims with silver watches
To your lovely face;
Your quiet footsteps
Wakes up from day-filled caves
Sadly departed souls,
Me and nocturnal birds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kaum in der wand, war er die mitte,
fastened its radius
over the garden, fields, for rent
The chicken stands, the radishes,
chenbeet, wurde umfassender, mondial:
We hung up the hat.
jacken und rahmen, hängten regenmäntel
and shines up, until we almost forgot him, whose hard look
will be there when we have moved out
and city and house and road
disappeared – so unmoved far up,
so shining over the west and the east,
that you could navigate in the dark
after him, and old seafarers a comfort.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when the october was hanging in the astwerk,
was it time: we
plucked quits, turned yellow grains into the kitchen
under water. ripe apples and pears
her name, a simple sweet –
anders als die quitte an ihrem baum im hintersten winkel
my alphabet, in the latin of the garden,
hard and strange in their aroma. we cut,
fourth, declosing the flesh (four large hangings, two small),
in the steam of the sink, gave
sugar, heat, fatigue to something that
who could, wanted to understand,
they poured, in bauchig glasses for the
dark days in den regalen aufge-
in a keller of days, where they lit, lit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've sewn diamonds into your wardrobe so you can buy bread
I put the sleeping animal in the backpack and a glass of jam to it, but psssst
I rolled your underpants under the sheet, you have to unpack them quickly
I put the papers in this bag downstairs, that's not, you know.
I put a little money in the coat, maybe you can
I put my grandfather's watch in the vase by the window, they don't want to stop you.
I put a pen in this envelope and a letter to the uncle, give it to him.
I separated the star from the jacket, so it's better
I burned all the stars, now every night is black
I seem like I've given all the advice, and now I don't have any more.
I've sewn diamonds into your wardrobe, but...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I leave this hut,
My dearest stay,
Wandle with wrapped steps
Through the barren, dark forest:
Luna breaks through bush and oak,
Zephyr reports her run,
And the birds with their branches
Let's get you the sweet garlic.
Wie ergötz’ ich mich im Kühlen
This beautiful summer night!
O how quiet it is to feel here,
What makes the soul happy!
Can hardly believe the beauty,
And yet I, Jesus, want you
Thousands of nights,
I wish my girl was me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, the eyes are back,
Those who once so kindly greeted me,
And it's the lips again,
Those who sweetened my life.
Auch die Stimme ist es wieder,
Who I once loved so much!
It's just me again.
I've come home changed.
Of the white, beautiful arms
Fest und liebevoll umschlossen,
I am now lying on her heart,
Dumpfen Sinnes und verdroßen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star falls down
From his shining hell,
This is the star of love,
I see him fall.
They fall from the apple tree,
The white leaves so much,
It's the soft breezes coming,
And they're playing with it.
It's the Swan in the Forest,
And rows up and down,
And falling silently,
He's going to the grave of a flood.
It's so quiet and dark,
Verweht ist Blatt und Blüt’,
The star is convulsively crushed,
Squawk the Swan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From all branches
The birds wandering,
Sound far through the air
When you hear the choir of the journey,
To South, to South
In the eternal flowering.
Your bird sings cheerfully
We sing out laughing,
When the Lenz comes,
Let's go back,
Wieder in Nest und Haus,
From the South!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Covered with flowering branches,
Chilled by playing West,
Lag Rosilis am Bache here
And Hylas next to her.
They sang funny songs,
She threw him flowers, he again;
She peed him, he peeled her,
Wer weiss wie lang’ und wie.
Touched by Lenz and by love,
Ward Hylas kissed him.
He kissed her, he pushed her.
That she cried for help.
Mother came swiftly and asked,
What Hylas did for Frevel here?
The daughter cried out, "It has happened,
You can go now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laziness, I finally have to give you
Also sing a little praise.
O how pissed I am,
To raise you to dignity!
Yes, I will do my best
After work rest well.
Whoever has you,
His uninterrupted life
I'm going to be matt
Now you will forgive me,
That I can't sing you;
You're preventing me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Um Mitternacht ging ich, nicht eben gerne,
Little little boy, look at that church.
To Father's house, the priest; star to star,
They all shined too brightly;
At midnight.
If I then further in life's width
To the love, must, because she moved,
and the north sun over me in battle,
I went, coming strange things;
At midnight.
Until the last of the full moon
So clear and clear to me in the Finstere drang,
Even the thought willing, persistent, quick
It was like the sound of the future.
At midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the doors I want to sneak,
Still and sittsam will I stand;
Fromme Hand wird Nahrung reichen,
And I'll go on.
Everyone will seem happy,
When my image appears before him;
He will cry a tear,
And I don't know what he's crying for.
Whom God will bestow righteousness,
He sends it into the wide world,
To whom he will show his wonders
In mountain and forest and stream and field.
The tears that lie at home,
Don't you get the morning red,
They know nothing but how to play with children.
Of sorrow, burden, and need for bread.
The streams of the mountains,
The larks are high in lust,
What shall I not sing with them
Full of throat and fresh chest.
I will only work for the love of God;
The stream, the lark, wind and the field,
And earth and heaven will be preserved,
Hat auch mein Sach’ aufs Best’ bestellt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashes red
Here come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
No one knows me there.
Wie bald, ach wie bald kommt die stille Zeit,
That's where I rest, and over me
Rauscht die schöne Waldeinsamkeit,
And no one knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your portrait wonderful
I have in my heart,
That looks so fresh and happy.
Me at every turn’.
My heart sings still
An old, beautiful song,
That blows in the air
And rushes towards you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's already late.
What are you doing in the woods?
The forest is long, you're alone,
You beautiful bride, I will take you home.
"What is great in men is folly and cunning,
My heart is broken by pain,
The foresthorn is coming and going,
You don't know who I am."
So richly adorned is Red and White,
So beautiful the young body,
Now I know you—God help me!
You're the witch Loreley.
"You know me well--of high stone
My castle is still looking down the Rhine.
It's already late.
Don't ever come out of this forest!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one knows and no one advises,
How I'm so well, so good!
Oh, if only there was one,
Nobody else should know!
So quiet ist’s nicht draußen im Schnee,
So silent and silent
The stars not in hell,
As my thoughts are.
I wish I was a bird
And bend over the sea,
Over the sea and further,
Until I was in heaven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens were,
The earth is sweetened,
That they may be in bloom
You must only dream of him.
The air went through the fields,
The ears were weighed down,
It's raining down the woods,
So bright was the night.
And my soul was resting
Far from their wings,
Flog through the silent land,
Like she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It smokes the apples, and it shivers,
As they made this Stund’
About the half-dead walls
Die alten Götter die Rund’.
Here behind the myrtle trees
In secretly dawning glory,
What do you talk like in dreams,
To me, fantastic night?
All stars are shining on me
With a sparkling love kiss,
It talks trunken the distance
Like from future great happiness!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleeping in the Laundry
Up is the old knight;
Rain showers pour,
And the forest bursts out through the grid.
Growing beard and hair,
And hides chest and crayon,
Seated many hundreds of years
Up in the silent clause.
Outside it's quiet and peaceful,
Everybody's gone to the valley,
Woodbirds Singing lonely
Into the empty arcade.
A wedding goes down there
On the Rhine in the sunshine,
Musicians play cheerfully,
And the beautiful bride weeping.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can hear the streams roaring
In the woods,
In the woods, in the noise
I don't know where I am.
Die Nachtigallen schlagen
Here in loneliness,
Like they were trying to say something.
From the good old days.
The moonlight stars fly,
As I sing underneath
The castle in the valley,
It's so far from here!
In the garden
Full of roses white and red,
My love waiting for me,
And he's been dead for so long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I can sing sometimes
Like I'm happy,
But secretly tears rise,
It frees my heart.
It leave nightingales,
Playing out in the spring air,
Sound the longing song
From her dungeon.
All hearts are there,
And all are pleased,
But no one feels the pain,
In the song the deep sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind will blow the wings,
The trees are stirring,
Wolken ziehn wie schwere Träume—
What does that gray mean?
Do you love a deer before others,
Don't leave it grasping alone.
Hunters walk in the woods and blow,
Stimmen hin und wieder wandern.
Do you have a boyfriend,
Don't trust him at this hour.
Friendly with eyes and mouths,
He senses war in vain peace.
Was heut gehet müde unter,
Reborn tomorrow.
Some things are lost in the night—
Be alert and alert!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a wedding along the mountain,
I heard the birds screaming,
There were many horsemen, and the horn sounded,
That was a fun hunt!
And before I knew it, everything was ruined,
The night covers the round;
Only from the mountains comes the forest
And I feel it in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Überm Garten durch die Lüfte
When I hear birds flying,
This means spring scents,
It's starting to bloom down here.
May I sing, may I cry,
I feel like I can’t be!
Old miracles appear again
In with the moonlight.
And the moon, the stars say it,
And in dreams, the grove grows
And the Nightingales beat it:
She's yours.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the forests were sleeping,
He to dig hub,
Rastlos in Berges Tiefen
He dug for a treasure.
The angels of God sang
At night's silence,
Like red eyes
Metals from the shaft.
“And become mine!” and grimmer
He's going down and down!
There will fall stones and ruins
Down on the fool.
Hearing the sound of the hornsteps
From the ruined crypt,
The Angel's Ange
Woefully in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two young men went forth
For the first time from home,
So cheerful right into the bright,
Sounding, singing waves
Out of the full spring.
They desired high things,
They wanted, despite desire and pain,
To do right in the world,
And to whom they passed,
The laughing soul and heart.
The first to find a lover,
The widow buys the farm and the house;
He soon weighed a trundle.
And looked out of hiding
Comfortably out in the field.
The second sang and lied
The thousand voices in the ground,
And they rose up, and set off,
Take him into the burning woes,
In the Wogen coloured lund.
And as he appeared from the womb,
He was tired and old,
His shiplein that was in the bottom,
So quiet was the round table,
And over the water it is cold.
Sound and sing the waves
The spring is upon me,
And I see so keen fellows,
The tears in my eyes flutter—
Oh, God, lead us to You sweetly!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, worldly consolation, you silent night!
How do you get away from the mountains,
The airs are all sleeping,
A shipwrecked man, wandering,
Singing his ballad over the sea
God's praise in the harbor.
The years like the clouds go
And leave me here lonely,
The world has forgotten me,
That's when you came to me,
When I'm in the woods,
I've been thinking.
O Trost der Welt, du stille Nacht!
The day has made me so tired
The wide sea is already dark,
Let me rest from lust and need,
Until the eternal dawn
The quiet forest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashes red
Here come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
No one knows me there.
Wie bald, ach wie bald kommt die stille Zeit,
That's where I rest, and over me
Rauscht die schöne Waldeinsamkeit,
And no one knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the heavens were,
The earth is sweetened,
That they may be in bloom
You must only dream of him.
The air went through the fields,
The ears were weighed down,
It's raining down the woods,
So bright was the night.
And my soul was resting
Far from their wings,
Flog through the silent land,
Like she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the sun shines brightly
Like in Welshland loud and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the overgrown Au’.
In the night the lover listened
At the window sweet erwartet,
Wish me and you both,
Homely a nice night.
When the sun shines brightly
Like in Welshland loud and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the overgrown Au’.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Past is the day of light,
The sound of the bells comes from afar;
So travels time all night long,
Take some who don’t think.
Wo ist nun hin die bunte Lust,
The friend's comfort and true chest,
The loveliest sweet smile?
Doesn't anybody want to talk to me?
Frisch auf denn, liebe Nachtigall,
You waterfall with a bright sound!
To praise God together we want,
Until the light of the morning shines.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think she was at the window.
And the hair flies sadly,
The hunter had gone away,
The hunter was her lover.
And when spring came,
The world was full of blossoms
She has taken a heart
And went into the green hedgehog.
She puts her ear on the lawn,
Hear also the sound of the horn –
These are the deer that grasp
At the shady mountain slope.
And in the evenings the woods roar,
From afar just falls another shot,
There she stands still to listen:
„Das war meines Liebsten Gruß!“
Then sprang from the rock the springs,
Then the birds fled into the valley.
“And when you meet him, you fellows,
O, greet him a thousand times!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above silent heights
There was a house in the forest;
So lonely it was to see,
There over the forest.
A girl sat in it
By silent evening,
Threaded threads spin
To her wedding dress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and see,
In field and forest and valley,
From the mountain down into the meadow;
Viel schöne, hohe Fraue,
I'll greet you a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Viel’ Blumen, schön und fein,
A great crown I will wind
A thousand thoughts I bind
And greetings with darein.
I can't give her any money,
She's too tall and beautiful,
They've all got to float,
Love cannot be without
Stay in your heart forever.
I seem to be happy
And move on and on,
And as if the heart were falling,
I dig away and sing,
And soon I will dig my grave.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lindes Rauschen in den Wipfeln
Bird flying away
Bronze from the silent peaks,
Tell me where my home is?
Today in my dreams I saw her again,
And from all the mountains
Such greetings to me,
That I began to cry.
Oh! here on the strange peaks:
Menschen, Quellen, Fels und Baum -
Everything's like a dream to me!
Muntre Vögel in den Wipfeln
Your associates in the valley,
Greet me from the strange peaks
My home a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and see,
In field and forest and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
From the mountain up to the blue:
Say hello a thousand times.
In my garden I find
A lot of flowers beautiful and fine;
I will wind much crown thereof,
A thousand thoughts I bind,
And greetings with darein.
I can't give you one.
You're too tall and beautiful,
You're going too fast.
Love without Likeness
Stay in your heart forever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I'd walk in the woods,
In the woods, it's so sappy,
With her starry coat
Cover me there,
There come the little ones gone,
Are you sure I'm sleeping?
I don’t sleep, I still hear
To the Nightingale,
When the apples grow on me,
It's ringing all night,
These are the thoughts in my heart,
They sing when no one's watching.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read you deep inside,
Do not hide this from me,
What a magical creature
It's your voice!
So many words
Ans Ohr uns ohne Plan
And while they gloat,
Everything's plugged in!
Doch drängt auch nur von ferne
Your tone to me,
I love it so much,
I can hardly forget him.
I'll be drinking then,
From allzurascher Glut:
My heart and your voice
They understand too well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How am I tempted in the night,
And I felt drawn to you,
I left the alleys guarded by a guard,
Transfigured softly
The night, the night...
The Gothic Gate.
The river flowed through a rocky shaft,
I leaned over the bridge,
Deep beneath me, I took note of the wogen,
They were so gentle
The night, the night...
But there wasn't a back.
It was spinning up, unfolding in countless ways
Melodic change of stars,
With them the moon in peaceful splendor,
They shivered softly
The night, the night...
Through a disgustingly distant distance.
I looked up in the night,
And looked down upon the new;
Woe, how hast thou spent the days,
Now shut your mouth,
The night, the night...
In the weary heart, repentance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sneaking around
Deaf and dumb,
You ask, o ask
Not me, why?
Heart shaken
Some punishment!
And can I ever
Too dark?
The tree is rotten,
The scent vanishes,
The leaves lie
So yellow in the beet,
There's a thunderbolt
Come in with might,
And can I ever
Too dark?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The power that ran next to me, where is it now?
The bird whose song I was listening to, where is he now?
Wo ist die Rose, die die Freundin am Herzen trug
And that kiss that deceived me, where is it now?
And that person I've been, and long ago
I switched with someone else, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're saying I lied to you,
Raise it up and honour it
I know you loved me.
You love no more alone!
Your beautiful eye was burning,
The kisses were burning,
You loved me, confess,
You love no more alone!
I am not counting on new ones,
Rejoicing return;
Just pretend that you loved,
And don't love me any more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love lied,
The worry is heavy,
Betrayed, ach!
It's all around me!
Light drops are falling
Wange stets herab,
Let go, let go knock,
Let go, my heart, let go!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is broken, you don't love me!
You told me you didn't love me!
Even though I appeared to you pleasing and encouraging,
And loveflies, you don't love me!
You spoke it out with words,
I know you don't love me!
So shall I make the stars, and the moon,
Missing the sun? you do not love me!
What is the rose blooming for me, what are the jasmines,
You don't love me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eyes are clouded, my mouth is silent,
You're calling me talking, that's it!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is red,
And whatever you want, that's a commandment.
My hair is grey, my heart is wound,
You're so young and so healthy.
You hate me and you make it so hard.
I look at you and I squeal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
Like in waking dreams
Does his picture creep into my mind,
Arise from the deepest darkness,
Heller just empor.
Otherwise is light and colourless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
Not begehr ich mehr,
Would rather cry,
Quiet in the chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How milder, how good!
Hold your lips, clear eyes,
Heller Sinn und fester Mut.
Like there in the blue depths,
Hell and glorious, that star,
So he at my heaven,
Hell and glorious, holy and fern.
Wandle, wandle your tracks;
Just look at your spectacle,
Look at him with humility,
Be happy and be sad!
Don't listen to my silent prayer,
Your happiness is only vouchsafed;
Can't you know me, Maggie?
High star of glory!
Nur die Würdigste von allen
May your choice be blessed,
And I will bless the high places,
A thousand times.
Will I be happy then and cry,
Blessed be I then.
Should my heart break too,
Brich, o Herz, was liegt daran?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't believe it.
It was a dream that stirred me;
How could he not be among them?
My arms lifted up and blessed?
I heard him say:
"I am forever yours"—
It was—I still dream,
It can't be that way.
O let in dreams die me,
Wounded on his chest,
The Lord's death
In tears of endless lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringleaf,
I'll hold your faithful tongue,
Pray to my heart.
I dreamed of him,
Childhood peaceful dream,
I found myself, lost
In the desert, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me,
Hast meinem Blick erschlossen
Of life's infinite, deep value.
I want to serve him, to live with him
To Him belong all,
Hin selber geben und finden
Reveals me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringleaf,
I'll hold your faithful tongue,
Pray to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, sisters,
Gently decorate me,
The lucky man serves me today,
It's business
I'll take care of you
Noch der blühenden Myrte Zier.
When I satisfied,
Happy hearts,
Otherwise in the arms of the beloved,
Still calling,
Desire in the heart,
Impatient for today.
Help me, sisters,
Help me lose it
A foolish impatience,
That I was clear
Aug him welcome,
Him, the source of bliss.
You, my beloved,
You appeared to me
Do you give me, sun, your veil?
Let me in Andacht,
Let me be humbled,
Let me submit to the Lord's.
Streuet ihm, Schwestern,
Leave him flowers,
Bring him petals of roses,
But you, sisters,
I greet you with sadness,
Pleasure to be part of your pack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you're looking
I wonder,
Can't you see?
How I can cry;
Leave the damp beads
Unknown plants
Freudig hell erzittern
In the eye of me!
Like so bang my bust,
How adorable!
If I could just say,
I don’t know how to say it;
Come and take hold of your face
Here on my chest,
Will whisper into your ear
All my lust.
Do you know the tears,
I can cry,
You're not supposed to see her.
You beloved man?
Stay in my heart,
Fill his blow,
That I'd hold on tighter
Just to hold you.
Here at my bed
Hat die Wiege Raum,
Wo sie still verberge
My fair dream;
The morning will come,
Wo der Traum erwacht,
And from it your image
Smiles at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my chest,
You my pleasure, you my desire!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and I'm not taking it back.
I've overestimated myself,
I'm happy now.
Only those who suck, only those that love
The child to whom she feeds;
Nur eine Mutter weiss allein,
Love means to be happy.
O, how do I pity the man,
I can't feel the joy of motherhood!
Dear angel,
You look at me and smile!
On my heart, on my chest,
You my pleasure, you my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you've done me the first pain,
But it hit.
You sleep, you hard, unfaithful man,
The sleep of death.
It flickers in front of it,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
Not alive.
I draw myself back into my innards,
The veil falls,
I got you and my lost happiness,
My world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decorated with myrtle and bridal gown,
The gardener's daughter, the rosy maiden
Tritt ein in den Zwinger des Löwen; er liegt
The mistress to his feet, in front of whom he wigs.
The Violent, wild and indomitable before,
Acts pious and wise toward the mistress;
The Virgin, tender and noble,
Sweeten him gently and weep at the same time:
„Wie waren in Tagen, die nicht mehr sind,
True plays, like child and child,
And loved and cherished us;
The days of childhood, they lie far away.
"You shake mightily, until we believe,
Your mighty royal head;
I grow, you see it: I am
The child no longer with childish sense.
"If I were the child, and stayed with you,
My strong, faithful, my truthful animal;
But I must follow; they have done it to me,
To the stranger, to a strange man.
„Es fiel ihm ein, dass schön ich sei,
I've been freed, it's over now:
The crown in my hair, my good company,
And no more eyes in the darkness of tears.
“Do you understand me fully?
I'm safe, so be safe with you.
There I see him come, I must follow him,
That is how I give you my last kiss, my friend.”
And as his lips touch the girl's lips,
They felt the wing tremble,
And as he sees the youth at the wing,
Excited the frightened bride.
He stands at the door of the conveyor to the watch,
He swings the swine, he whisperes with power;
Rejoicing, commanding and threatening
He goes out in anger, seeking a way out.
And out there, there's a loud roaring scream.
The youth cries out, “Bring weapons,
I shot him down, I met him good!"
The irritated growls shamefully with anger.
Die Unselige wagt’s sich der Türe zu nahn,
Then he falls transforming the mistress:
The beautiful figure, a nasty robbery,
Lies bluntly torn and disfigured in the dust.
And how he shed the precious blood,
He lays himself upon the body with disdain,
He is so lost in grief and sorrow,
Bis tödlich die Kugel ihn trifft in das Herz.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky is purified and blue,
The Reif is displaying flowers.
There's a flickering flower on the window.
A young man stands, looking at him, before him.
And behind the flowers blossom
A blue, smiling pair of eyes.
Märzveilchen, wie jener noch keine gesehn.
The reif is hacked up and crushed.
Ice flowers begin to melt,
And God be merciful to the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mother prays and sees
Excited by the sleeping little one.
He rests in the crib so gently and so cheerfully.
He must be an angel to her.
She kisses him and herds him, barely holding herself.
Forget the earthly pain,
Their hopes are waning in the future.
That's how mothers dream.
The raven with the siblings
Round the way outside the window:
Your angel, your angel will be ours!
The robber serves us for food!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It goes with steeped drum sound;
How far still the place! the way how long!
O wär er zur Ruh und alles vorbei!
I think I'm breaking my heart.
I only loved him in the world,
He's the only one to be given death now.
At ringing games is paralyzed,
That's what I'm commanded to do.
Now he looks back for the last time
In the sun of God joyful shine,
And now they close their eyes to him,
Give thee eternal rest.
Then Nine have set up,
Eight balls passed.
They all tremble with mourning and pain—
But I, I met him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the town there is a lot of excitement,
So they hold the wedding with dance and with play,
The Merry-go-round is so bright,
The bride is only like the desired death.
Yes, dead for him whom she does not forget,
Who is not a bridegroom at the wedding,
He stands in the midst of the guests,
And play the violin funny enough!
He strokes the violin, his hair grooves,
The strings swing loud and clear,
He touches her heart and doesn't care,
Whether it also breaks in a thousand pieces.
It's awful to see someone dying like that.
When a young man's heart blossoms with joy
I like and I don't want to see it any longer!
That would turn my head in disbelief.
Who's calling you finger pointing at me?
O God! Bless us,
That none can be overcome by madness;
I'm a poor musician myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
Like in waking dreams
Does his picture creep into my mind,
Arise from the deepest darkness,
Heller just empor.
Otherwise is light and colourless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
Not begehr ich mehr,
Would rather cry,
Quiet in the chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How milder, how good!
Hold your lips, clear eyes,
Heller Sinn und fester Mut.
Like there in the blue depths,
Hell and glorious, that star,
So he at my heaven,
Hell and glorious, holy and fern.
Wandle, wandle your tracks;
Just look at your spectacle,
Look at him with humility,
Be happy and be sad!
Don't listen to my silent prayer,
Your happiness is only vouchsafed;
Can't you know me, Maggie?
High star of glory!
Nur die Würdigste von allen
May your choice be blessed,
And I will bless the high places,
A thousand times.
Will I be happy then and cry,
Blessed be I then.
Should my heart break too,
Brich, o Herz, was liegt daran?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't believe it.
It was a dream that stirred me;
How could he not be among them?
My arms lifted up and blessed?
I heard him say:
"I am forever yours"—
It was—I still dream,
It can't be that way.
O let in dreams die me,
Wounded on his chest,
The Lord's death
In tears of endless lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringleaf,
I'll hold your faithful tongue,
Pray to my heart.
I dreamed of him,
Childhood peaceful dream,
I found myself, lost
In the desert, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me,
Hast meinem Blick erschlossen
Of life's infinite, deep value.
I want to serve him, to live with him
To Him belong all,
Hin selber geben und finden
Reveals me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden ringleaf,
I'll hold your faithful tongue,
Pray to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, sisters,
Gently decorate me,
The lucky man serves me today,
It's business
I'll take care of you
Noch der blühenden Myrte Zier.
When I satisfied,
Happy hearts,
Otherwise in the arms of the beloved,
Still calling,
Desire in the heart,
Impatient for today.
Help me, sisters,
Help me lose it
A foolish impatience,
That I was clear
Aug him welcome,
Him, the source of bliss.
You, my beloved,
You appeared to me
Do you give me, sun, your veil?
Let me in Andacht,
Let me be humbled,
Let me submit to the Lord's.
Streuet ihm, Schwestern,
Leave him flowers,
Bring him petals of roses,
But you, sisters,
I greet you with sadness,
Pleasure to be part of your pack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you're looking
I wonder,
Can't you see?
How I can cry;
Leave the damp beads
Unknown plants
Freudig hell erzittern
In the eye of me!
Like so bang my bust,
How adorable!
If I could just say,
I don’t know how to say it;
Come and take hold of your face
Here on my chest,
Will whisper into your ear
All my lust.
Do you know the tears,
I can cry,
You're not supposed to see her.
You beloved man?
Stay in my heart,
Fill his blow,
That I'd hold on tighter
Just to hold you.
Here at my bed
Hat die Wiege Raum,
Wo sie still verberge
My fair dream;
The morning will come,
Wo der Traum erwacht,
And from it your image
Smiles at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my chest,
You my pleasure, you my desire!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and I'm not taking it back.
I've overestimated myself,
I'm happy now.
Only those who suck, only those that love
The child to whom she feeds;
Nur eine Mutter weiss allein,
Love means to be happy.
O, how do I pity the man,
I can't feel the joy of motherhood!
Dear angel,
You look at me and smile!
On my heart, on my chest,
You my pleasure, you my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you've done me the first pain,
But it hit.
You sleep, you hard, unfaithful man,
The sleep of death.
It flickers in front of it,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
Not alive.
I draw myself back into my innards,
The veil falls,
I got you and my lost happiness,
My world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream of our own days,
Those who are far away,
My daughter's daughter,
You sweet little one,
Take before the fatigue
Cover the tomb,
Take a fresh start
My blessing.
You see me grey of hair,
Abgezehrt und bleich.
Bin, wie du, gewesen
Young and rich,
Love, as you love,
Ward, like you, also bride,
And you, too, will age,
Like I bury.
Let time fly by
Wandeln fort und fort,
Only true
Your son's host;
Did I once say,
I won’t take it back.
Happiness is only love,
Love only is happiness.
When I loved him,
Placed in the grave,
Hab ich meine Liebe
Trusted in me:
Was my heart broken,
I've had the courage,
And the age of ashes
Hold on to the good ol' glut.
Take before the fatigue
Cover the tomb,
Take a fresh start
My blessing:
Must break your heart,
Hold on tight,
Be the pain of love
Then your highest good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That night we kissed, o girl,
Nobody looked at us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We trusted the stars.
It's a star fallen,
He's been complaining to the sea,
There the sea has it to the rowing,
The rudder to the skipper.
Then sang the same sailor
His love.
Now sing it on the streets and markets
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hab’ oft im Kreise der Lieben
Resting in fragrant grass,
And singing me a song,
And everything was pretty and good.
Hab’ einsam auch mich gehärmet
And had no sense of humor
Doch kam ich wieder zu singen
Everything was fine again.
And some of what I learn,
I will rejoice in peace,
But I came to sing again,
Everything was fine again.
And thou shalt not klagen lange,
Whatever hurts you,
Just fresh, just fresh sung!
And everything's gonna be all right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going out in a sad wind,
Love wept so much,
I feel my foot hurt, my shoulder hurt.
Heart, that's so hard for me.
What do you sing, birds, in the dawn?
You don't know how to divorce!
Don't worry and wear shoes;
You birds, you're good!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
