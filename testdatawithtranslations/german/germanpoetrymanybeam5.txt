I think of you,
When the sun shines on me
Shines from the sea;
I think of you,
When the shimmer of the moon
Paints in springs.
I see you,
When on the far road
The dust is rising,
In the deep night,
When on the narrow footbridge
The wanderer trembles.
I hear you,
When there with muffled noise
The wave rises.
In the quiet grove I often go to listen,
When all is silent.
I am with you,
Though thou be far away,
You are near me!
The sun is sinking,
Soon the stars will shine on me.
Oh, would you be there!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
bundles the city and in the park
over the roads where the summer is burned
stand the sails of the smoke.
we sacrifice your chastity first, sweetest
and receive the gift of language for this
exhausted and dissolved the bodies lie
in the shadow of the talk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh food, fresh blood
I breathe from the free world:
How precious and good is Nature,
That holds me by my breast!
The wave is bending our bark
Upwards in a row of wheels,
And mountains, cloudy in the sky,
Against our course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye, my eye, why do you sink?
Golden dreams, will you come again?
Farewell, dream! so gold thou art:
Here, too, is love and life.
On the wave a thousand stars are twinkling,
Soft mist drinks rings the thundering distance;
Morning breezes sweep The shadowed bay,
And in the lake the ripening fruit reflects itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional yearning then takes place
When longing adds the other
what even fulfillment, if it existed, lacked.
as at evening at the window in the mixed light
ties the unknown to the absolute
and the distance dissolves into distance. i am calling:
I don't want anything of what I already know!
otherwise there are cold loneliness
as there is cold cough in paris restaurants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the crucified, this frog lay
Rolled flat on the hot asphalt
Of the country road. Open mouths
Bow to the sun-tormented sky,
Like a shoe sole from a distance –
An amphibious from an older age,
Beneath the wheels in the leap.
No resurrection but in the larvae
Of the flies that will hatch tomorrow.
By what aperture does the dream escape?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feeling a feeling of emptiness
Something’s gnawing at your inside
They look around with their heads bowed low
How you would like to be someone else
Give yourself into our hands
We turn you
without hesitation
Into its opposite
They're dripping
We dry you out
They are withered
We stimulate your juices
They insist on being a man
We alter your anatomy
They tend to gentleness
We set you in frenzy
They squint outward
We invert your gaze
They doubt
We fulfill you with certainty
They're scared
We hang you
on your teeth
beneath the circus dome
They rest in themselves
We will tear you to pieces
They breathe health
We contaminate you
Should be in you
as a belated aftermath
the desire to germinate
to be a person with his contradiction
we put you dialectically in the middle
The magicians and magnetisers of the house
stand at your service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of the First Light,
Image of tenderness in sorrow!
Mist swims with a silver shower
Around thy charming face;
Of thy soft foot's run
Wakes from caverns sealed to the day
Sadly departed souls,
Me and the birds of the night.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hardly in the wall, he was the middle,
his radius sped
over the gardens, fields and furrows
the chicken stalls, the radish-
chenbeet, became more extensive, mondial:
we hung up the caterpillars. we hanged up wicker-
jackets and frames, raincoats hanging
and parasols, till we almost forgot about him, whose hard gaze
Will still be there when we've retired
and city and house and street
vanished – so undismayed far above,
so shining across the east and west,
that could be navigated in the dark
for him, and for old sailors a solace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when October hung it in the branches,
full-fledged lanterns, it was time: we
plucked quinces, bulked in baskets of yellow into the kitchen
under water. apple and pear ripen
to its name, to a simple sweetness –
unlike the quince on its tree in the back corner
of my alphabet, in the Latin of the garden,
hard and strange in their aroma. we cut,
quatrained, gutted the flesh (four large hands, two small),
disguised in the steam of the juicer, gave
sugar, heat, toil to something
raw collapsed. who could, who wanted to accept,
ye gelee, in bauchigen gläsern for die
dark days on the shelves
in a cellar of days where they glowed, glow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I sewed diamonds into your skirt hem so you can buy bread
I put the sleeping animal in the backpack and a jar of jam with it, but wh-wh
I rolled your underwear under the sheet, you have to unpack it fast
I stuffed the papers into this pocket downstairs, so why not, you know
I put some money in my coat, maybe you can
I put Grandpa's watch in the vase by the window, they're not supposed to stop you,
I put a pen in this envelope and a letter to my uncle, give it to him
I have severed the star from my jacket, so it is better
I have burned all the stars, now every night is black
It seems I’ve given all advice, now I have none
I sewed diamonds into your skirt hem, but wh-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now do I leave this cottage,
Of my dearest's stay,
Convert with veiled steps
Through the barren, murky woods:
Moon breaks through bushes and oaks,
Zephyr announces her departure,
And the birches strew with bowing
To you the sweet incense.
How, in the cooling air, I feel a need
This beautiful summer night!
Oh, how quiet it is to feel here,
What makes the soul happy!
The bliss can hardly be grasped,
And yet, heaven, I wanted you
A thousand such nights have passed,
If only my girl would give one to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, it is the eyes, once again,
Who once so sweetly greeted me,
And it is the lips again,
That sweetened my life.
Again it is the voice,
That I so gladly once belonged to!
Only I myself am not again,
I have returned home changed.
From the white lovely arms
Firmly and lovingly enclosed,
I lie on her heart now,
Dull in meaning and dreary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A star is falling
From its sparkling height,
That is the star of love,
That I see falling there.
The apple trees are falling,
Of white leaves so many,
There come the neighing breezes,
And play their game with it.
The swans are singing in the pond,
And rows up and down,
And ever more softly singing,
He dives into the flood-grave.
It is so still and dark,
Leaf and flower are blown away,
The star is tremblingly shattered,
The song of the swans was heard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swaying from all the branches
Wandering birds ascend,
Far through the airs sound
One hears the traveling choir,
To south, south
Into the eternal flower-bed.
Your little bird sings cheerfully down,
We sing merrily outside,
When spring comes,
Come we again,
Again in nest and in house,
From the South! Out now!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaded by blossoming boughs,
Chilled by Wests playing,
Rosilis lay by the stream here
And Hylas beside her.
They sang to each other joking songs,
She threw him with flowers, and he again;
She neckled him, he necked her,
Who knows how long and how.
Touched by spring and by love,
When Hylas was driven to kiss.
He kissed her, he pressed her
That she cried out for help.
The mother came swiftly and asked,
What foul deeds did Hylas dare to do here?
The daughter cried: "It has happened,
You may now go again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laziness, at last I must tell you
Sing a little song of praise. –
Oh, how angry he will be to me,
Singing of your dignity!
But, I will do my best,
After work it is good to rest.
Highest Good! Who only has thee,
Whose undisturbed life
Oh! I yawn I grow weary
So thou may'st forgive me,
That I cannot sing you;
You prevent me from doing it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Around midnight I went, not as gladly,
Little little boy, to that churchyard
To Father's house, the parson; star by star,
They all shone too beautifully;
Around midnight.
Then, when I am farther on in life's expanse
To the dearest must, must because she moved,
The stars and the northern lights above me in strife,
I sought bliss as I went on, or came;
Around midnight.
Till at last the brightness of the full moon
So clearly and distinctly thrust me into the dark,
Thought too willingly, tenaciously, swiftly
About the past as about the future;
Around midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will sneak into the doors,
I will stand still and virtuous;
A pious hand will offer sustenance,
And I will go on.
Everyone will think they're happy
When my picture appears before him;
A tear he shall weep,
And I don't know what he's crying.
---------------------------------------------------------- Whoever wishes to do God righteous favour,
He sends into the wide world,
To this he wishes to point out his wonders,
In mountain and wood and stream and field.
The tears that lie at home,
Does not the dawn revive,
They only know about child-weighing,
Of cares, burdens, and need for bread.
The little streams leap from the mountains,
The lark whirls high in delight,
Why should I not sing with them
From a full throat and a fresh chest.
I only let the dear God act;
Of little streams, lark, wind and field,
And earth and heaven will be preserved,
Has ordered my deeds to the best.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashes of red
There come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
No one there knows me any more.
How soon, oh, how soon the silent time will come,
There, too, I rest, and above me
The beautiful loneliness of the woods roars,
And no one here knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your picture wondrously
In the depths of my heart,
That looks so fresh and gay
Me at every hour.
My quiet heart sings within itself
An old and lovely song,
That swings in the air
And hurries to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is already late, already it is cold,
Why ridest thou through the wood alone?
The wood is long, you are alone,
You beautiful bride! I lead you home!
"Great is the man of deceit and cunning,
My heart is broken by pain,
Perhaps the wood horn is straying
Oh flee! You do not know who I am."
So richly adorned is horse and wife,
So beautiful the young body,
Now I know thee—God be with me!
You are the sorceress Lorelei.
"You know me well—of lofty stone
My castle looks quietly into the Rhine.
It is already late, already it is cold,
Nevermore out of this wood thou comest!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No one knows or advises,
How pleasant it is to me, so pleasant!
Oh, if only One, Only One could know,
Otherwise no man should know!
So still is it not outside in the snow,
So mute and silent are
The stars are not in the heavens,
Than my thoughts are.
I wish I were a little bird
And float across the sea,
Well, across the sea and beyond,
Until I am in heaven!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the sky
Kissed the earth in silence,
That in the shimmer of blossom
Only dream of him.
The air passed through the fields,
The ears swayed gently,
The woods murmured softly,
So starlit was the night.
And my soul was throbbing
Spreading their wings,
Flew through the silent lands,
As if flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The treetops rustle and the storms,
As if to make this hour
Around the half-sunken walls
The old gods the circle.
Here behind the myrtle trees
In secret dawning splendor,
As in dreams, how vainly do you speak,
To me, fantastic night?
All the stars are twinkling on me
With a glowing glance of love,
The distance talks drunkenly
As of great future happiness!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Falling asleep on the Lauer
Above is the old knight;
Rain showers are falling,
And the wood is rustling through the lattice.
Beard and hair, all grown in,
And petrified breast and caterpillar,
He sits many hundred years
Above in the silent cloister.
Outside it is quiet and peaceful,
All have gone down into the valley,
Forest birds sing lonely
Into the empty windowsill.
A wedding drives down there
Upon the Rhine in sunshine,
Musicians play cheerfully,
And the beautiful bride who is crying.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hear the little streams rustle
In the woods to and fro,
In the woods, in the rustling
I don't know where I am.
The nightingales beat
Here in the solitude,
As if they wanted to say something
Of the old, lovely time.
The moonlit skies are flying,
As if I saw beneath me
The castle lies in the valley,
And yet is so far from here!
As if in the garden
Full of roses white and red,
My dearest, waiting for me,
And has been dead so long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may sing at times,
As if I were happy,
But secretly tears enter,
Then my heart becomes free.
Nightingales leave it,
Plays the spring air outside,
The yearning song echoing
From the grave of her dungeon.
There all hearts listen,
And all is delighted
But none feel the pain,
In song the deepest grief.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Twilight spreads its wings
Trees shudder and stir,
Clouds move like heavy dreams—
What does this grass mean?
Do you love one dearest deer before another,
Don't let it graze alone,
Hunters move in the woods and blow,
Voices wander again and again.
Do you have a friend here below,
Do not trust him at this hour
Kindly, with eyes and mouths,
He wages war in a peace of tricks.
What's today going weary under,
Rises tomorrow, born anew.
Some are lost in the night—
Beware, be awake and cheerful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a wedding feast along the hill,
I heard the birds beat,
There many horsemen flashed, the wood horn sounded
That was fun to chase!
And all was done before I thought,
The night covers the round;
Only from the mountains still the forest murmurs
And it's in my heart that I shudder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the garden through the air
I heard migrating birds
That means the scent of spring,
Below, it's already beginning to bloom.
I'd like to wail, I want to cry,
Is it to me as if it could not be!
Old wonders shine again
With the gleam of the moon.
And the moon, the stars say,
And in dreams the grove rustles
And the nightingales are beating:
She is yours, she is thine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the woods slept,
He started digging,
Restless in mountain's depths
He was digging for a treasure.
The Angels of God sang
Meanwhile, in the still night,
As if red eyes were pressing
Metals from the shaft.
"And be mine!" and a grimace
He rummages and rumbles downwards!
There fall stones and rubble
Over the foolish man.
Laughter wildly sounded
From the decayed grave,
The angel's song echoed
Weeping in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two well-stocked fellows were dragging
For the first time from home,
So cheerfully straight into the bright,
Ringing, singing waves
Out of the full spring.
Striving for lofty things,
In spite of pleasure and pain,
What's right in the world to do,
And to whom they passed by,
The laughing senses and heart.
The first to find a lover
The bridegroom bought his manor and house;
He soon weighed a little dill,
And saw out of a secret dovecote
Into the field with ease.
To the second sang and lied
The thousand voices in the ground,
Enchanting sirens, and drew
Into the bubbling waves,
In the swamp's colored mouth.
And as he reappeared from the gorge,
There he was tired and old,
His little ship lay in the ground,
So still was it round and round,
And over the water it’s cold.
The waves sound and sing
Of Spring upon me;
And I see my fellows so keen
The tears in my eyes are swelling—
Oh, God, lead us sweetly to Thee!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, comfort of the world, silent night!
How gently from the mountains do you climb,
The breezes all sleep,
A mere mariner, tired of wandering,
Sings his vespers across the sea
To God's praise in the harbor.
The years pass like the clouds
And let me stand here alone,
The world has forgotten me,
There you came to me, marvellous,
When I, amid the murmur of the woods,
Sitting thoughtfully.
O solace of the world, silent night!
The day has made me so tired,
Already, the wide sea darkens,
Let me rest from want and need,
Till the eternal dawn
sparkling through the silent woods.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the flashes of red
There come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
No one there knows me any more.
How soon, oh, how soon the silent time will come,
There, too, I rest, and above me
The beautiful loneliness of the woods roars,
And no one here knows me any more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was as if the sky
Kissed the earth in silence,
That in the shimmer of blossom
Only dream of him.
The air passed through the fields,
The ears swayed gently,
The woods murmured softly,
So starlit was the night.
And my soul was throbbing
Spreading their wings,
Flew through the silent lands,
As if flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the sun so sweetly shines
As in Welshland, pale and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shiny meadows.
In the night my dear listened
At the window, expecting sweetly,
Me and you, the two of us,
Secretly, a beautiful night.
When the sun so sweetly shines
As in Welshland, pale and blue,
I went with the mandolin
Through the shiny meadows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bright day has passed,
From far away comes the sound of bells;
Thus travels time all night long,
Takes some with him who hasn't thought.
Where now is the colourful desire
The friend's consolation and chest,
The sweetest glance of my dearest?
Won't anybody want to be happy with me?
Fresh on then, dear nightingale,
You are a waterfall with a bright sound!
Let's praise God together,
Until the bright morning shines!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She must have been standing at the window
And sadly flows the hair,
The hunter was gone,
The hunter was her dearest.
And when the spring came,
The world was snowed with blossoms,
There she took a heart
And walked into the green hedge.
She puts her ear to the lawn,
He hears hooves farther sound –
These are the deer grazing
On the shadowy hillside.
And the woods rustle in the evening,
Only a shot falls from afar,
There she stands in silence listening:
"That was my darling's greeting!"
There sprang springs from the rock,
Then the little birds fled into the valley.
"And where you meet him, my fellows,
Oh, greet him a thousand times!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above silent heights
Standing in the wood was a house;
So lonely it was seen
There, beyond the woods.
A girl sat in it
In the still of evening,
Do silken threads spin
To her wedding gown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I gaze and pass,
In field and wood and valley,
From the mountain down to the meadow;
Much beauty, high lady,
I greet you a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Many flowers, fine and fair,
Many a wreath may I take from it,
And a thousand thoughts I bind
And greetings in that.
To her I may not give one,
It is too high and beautiful,
They must all vanish,
Love alone is unparalleled
Stays eternally in my heart.
I seem to think of gladsome things
And create ups and downs,
And, if the heart breaks,
I dig on and sing,
And bury my grave for me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rustling of lindens in the trees,
Little birds flying far away,
bronzes from the silent summits,
Says where my homeland lies?
Today in a dream I saw her again,
And from all the mountains
Such a salutation to me
That I began to cry.
Ah! here on the foreign summits:
People, fountains, rocks and trees--
All is like a dream to me!
Old birds in the treetops,
Your companions there in the valley,
Greets me from the foreign summits
My home a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I gaze and pass,
In field and wood and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
From the mountain top far in the blue:
I greet you a thousand times.
In my garden I find
Many flowers beautiful and fine;
I'll sooner or later wear a lot of wreaths,
And a thousand thoughts I bind,
And greetings in that.
To you I may not give one,
You are too high and beautiful,
They must vanish too soon,
Love unparalleled
Stays eternally in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I would lie in the wood,
In the woods it murmurs so softly,
With her starry mantle
There, the night covers me,
There come the little streams gone,
Do I sleep already?
I do not sleep, I hear for long
To the nightingales
When the trees above me are swaying,
It rings all night,
These are the thoughts within my heart
That sing when no one is awake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read deeply in you,
And this, too, do not conceal from me,
What a bewitched creature
Speaks from your voice!
So many words invade
To our ears without a plan
And while they sound,
All is tasted!
But even from afar
Your voice reaches out to me,
I listen to him so gladly,
I forget him so badly.
I tremble then, escaping
Of all-zurascher Glut:
My heart and your voice
Understand each other too well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I snatch myself up in the night,
And felt myself drawn again,
I left the streets guarded by a guard,
Treading softly
At night, at night
The gate with the Gothic arch.
The Mühlbach murmured through rocky shaft,
I leaned over the bridge,
Deep beneath, I took heed of the waves,
That fluttered so gently
At night, at night
But there was no return.
It wheeled above, innumerable ignited
Melodious change of the stars,
With them the moon in calm splendour,
They sparkled softly
At night, at night
Through the deceptively remote distance.
I gazed up in the night, at night
And looked down again;
Oh woe, how did you spend your days,
Now you are quiet, gentle,
At night, at night
Regret in my throbbing heart!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I creep around
Sad and mute,
You ask, oh ask
Me not, why?
The heart is shaken
So many sorrows!
And if I could ever
Too gloomy to be?
The tree withers,
The scent fades,
The leaves lie
So yellow in the bed,
There's a thunderstorm
In with might,
And if I could ever
Too gloomy to be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stream that rushed beside me, where is it now?
The bird whose song I listened to, where is it now?
Where is the rose that my friend bore in her heart,
And that kiss that intoxicated me, where is it now?
And that man who was I, and whom I have long
I exchanged with another, where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You say I was deceiving myself,
Swear it out loud and high,
I know that you loved,
Only you no longer love!
Your beautiful eye was burning,
The kisses burned a lot,
You loved me, admit it,
Only you no longer love!
I do not count on new,
Faithful return;
Just act so that you may love,
And love me no more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has lied,
Sorrow weighs heavily,
Cheated, oh! cheated
All has surrounded me!
Clear drops are pouring
Her cheek always lowered,
Turn off, turn off to knock,
Abort, my heart, abort!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is broken, you do not love me!
You let me know that you don't love me!
Although I appeared to you pleading and encouraging,
And love-flies, you do not love me!
You spoke it, you said it in words,
With absolute certainty, you do not love me!
So shall I the stars, and so the moon,
Missing the sun? You don't love me!
What blossoms the rose to me, what blooms the jasmine,
Why are the daffodils blooming? You don't love me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eye is dull, my mouth is mute,
You have called me to speak, that is why!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is red,
And what you wish for is a commandment.
My hair is grey, my heart is sore,
You are so young and so healthy!
You make it so difficult for me to speak.
I look at you so, and tremble so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I am blind;
Wherever I gaze,
I see him alone;
As in a waking dream
His image floats before me,
Appears from the depths of darkness,
Brighter upwards only.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me
After the sisters’ games
I no longer desire
Would rather weep,
Silently in the little chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright sense and firm courage.
As there, in the blue depths,
Bright and fair, that star,
So he in my sky,
Bright and glorious, lofty and distant.
Wander, wandering thy tracks;
Just look at your splendor,
Only look at him in humility,
Be blissful only and sad!
Hear not my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to thy bliss;
Don't let me know, dear maid,
Highest star of splendour!
Only the most dignified of all
May your choices bring you delight,
And I will bless the high,
Many thousands of times.
Will I rejoice then and weep,
Blessed, blessed am I;
Should my heart break,
Brich, O heart, what is there to it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot grasp it, cannot believe,
A dream has obsessed me;
How would he, among all the others,
That lifts me up and makes me happy?
It was to me that he had spoken:
"I am yours forever"—
For me it was—I dreamed still,
It can never be like this.
Oh let me die in dreams,
Weighs on his breast,
Whispering the blissful death
In tears of endless delight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ringlet,
I press you piously to my lips,
Thy devotion to my heart.
I had dreamed of him,
The peaceful dream of childhood,
I found myself alone, lost
In desolate, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me
You opened my eyes
Of life's infinite, profound worth.
I will serve it and live for it,
Belongs entirely to Him,
To give myself and find
Enlightens me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ringlet,
I press you piously to my lips,
Thy devotion to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, my sisters,
Kindly adorn me,
The fortunate will serve me today,
Winds busily
Around my brow
Nor the blooming myrtle ornaments.
When I am satisfied,
Of a joyful heart,
Unless it lay in the arms of its lover,
Still he shouted
Longing in my heart,
Unhurried today.
Help me, my sisters,
Help me evaporate
A foolish anxiety,
That I with clear
Eye may receive him,
Him, the source of joyfulness.
You are, my lover,
You appeared to me,
Sun, do you give me your light?
Let me in reverence,
Let me in humility,
Let me bow to my master mine.
Scatters to him, sisters,
Scatters flowers to it,
Bring the budding roses to him,
But to you, sisters,
I greet with melancholy,
Joyfully departing from your crowd.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you are gazing
Astonishes me,
Can't you understand
How I can cry;
Let the damp pearls
Unfamiliar ornament
Trembling gaily bright
In my sight!
How so restless my bosom,
How so blissfully!
If I only knew in words
How shall I say it;
Come and bend your countenance
Here on my chest,
Will whisper in your ear
All my desire.
Do you know the tears now,
That I can cry for,
Shall you not see them
You, my dearest man?
Stay with my heart,
Feeling its blow,
That I, firm and firmer,
Only you may press.
Here on my bed
Does the cradle have room,
Where it silently hides
My sweet dream;
The morning will come,
Where dreams awaken,
And from this thy image
Laugh at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
My delight, my desire!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and I do not take it back.
Overwhelmingly esteemed myself,
But I am overjoyed now.
Only she who nurtures and loves
The child to whom it gives its nourishment;
Only a mother knows,
What love means and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man
The feeling of motherly bliss!
Dear, dear angel, you
You look at me and smile on me!
On my heart, on my breast,
My delight, my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have given me my first pain,
But he hit.
You sleep, you hard-hearted, merciless man,
The sleep of death.
The woman in the house is looking ahead,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
No longer alive.
I quietly retreat into my inner self,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
O my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decorated with myrtle and bridal smooth,
The janitor's daughter, the rosy maid,
Steps into the lion's kennel; he lies
At the mistress' feet, in front of which he nestles.
The mighty one, wild and reckless before,
Look up to your mistress devoutly and sensibly;
The maiden, delicate and full of fragrance,
Caress him gently and at the same time weep:
"How were in days that are no more,
Even faithful games, like child and child,
And loved and loved us;
The days of childhood, they are far away.
"You trembled mightily before we believed,
Your moan-swept royal head;
I grew up, you see: I am
The child no longer with infantile sense.
"O, if I were still the child and stayed with you,
My strong, faithful, honest beast;
But I must follow, they did it to me,
Out into the stranger's man.
"He thought that I was beautiful,
I was set free, it is now over:
The wreath in her hair, my dear friend,
And eyes no longer bright before tears.
"Do you understand me? Look at me grimly,
I am ready, so be calm, you too;
There I see him coming, whom I must follow,
So, my friend, may I give you my last kiss!"
And how the maiden's lips touched him,
There, one felt the kennel trembling,
And as he looks at the young man in the kennel,
The anxious bride is appalled.
He stands at the door of the kennel on guard,
He swings his tail, he roars with might;
Demanding, begging, and threatening
Go out; in anger he blocks the way out.
Outside, confused cries are heard.
The youth cries, "Gather your weapons;
Shoot him down, I’ll shoot him right!”
The angry roar, foaming with rage.
The unfortunate dares to approach the door,
Then he turns and attacks the mistress:
The lovely figure, a ghastly robbery,
Lies bloodily torn and disfigured in the dust.
And how he shed the expensive blood,
He lays down on the corpse with eerie courage,
He lies so drowned in sorrow and in pain,
Until the bullet kills him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky is purple and blue,
The frost displays flowers.
At the window there's a flickering flower.
A young man stands looking at him.
And behind the flowers blossoms even
A blue, smiling pair of eyes.
Violets of March, such as this one have not yet seen.
The frost will breathe in and crumble away.
Ice-flowers begin to melt,
And God be merciful to the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mother prays heartily and looks
Delighting in the slumbering little one.
He rests in the cradle so gently and confident.
He must be an angel to her.
She kisses him and cuddles him, barely holding on.
Forgetful of earthly pains,
It sways its dream of hope into the future.
So dream mothers in the heart.
The raven, meanwhile, with his retinue
Circles outside the window the sage:
Your angel, your angel will be ours!
The robber is our food!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It goes with muffled drum sound;
How far the place is! how long the road!
Oh, that he could rest and all was over!
I think my heart is breaking in two.
I loved only him in this world,
Only him, to whom death is now given.
The sound of play is paraded,
For this I too am in command.
Now he looks up for the last time
In God's sunshine of gladness,—
Now they fasten their eyes to him,—
May God give you eternal rest!
Nine may well have devised it,
Eight bullets have swept by;
They all tremble with sorrow and pain—
But I, I found it right in my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the little town there is much cheer,
There they make their wedding feast with dance and play,
The wine of Merry gleams so red,
The bride is only like a fertilized death.
Yes, dead for the one she doesn't forget,
Who is not a bridegroom at the feast;
There he stands among the guests in the jug,
And caress the violin merry enough!
He strokes the violin, his hair gray,
The strings are swinging smooth and loud,
He presses it to his heart and pays no heed,
Whether it breaks into a thousand pieces.
It’s awful when someone dies like this,
When young his heart still entices for joy;
I like it and no longer want to see it!
That would dizzily turn my head.—
Who is it to point your fingers at me?
O God—have mercy on us,
That none can be conquered by madness;
I myself am a poor musician.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I am blind;
Wherever I gaze,
I see him alone;
As in a waking dream
His image floats before me,
Appears from the depths of darkness,
Brighter upwards only.
Otherwise is light and colorless
All around me
After the sisters’ games
I no longer desire
Would rather weep,
Silently in the little chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I am blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so mild, how so good!
Sweet lips, clear eye,
Bright sense and firm courage.
As there, in the blue depths,
Bright and fair, that star,
So he in my sky,
Bright and glorious, lofty and distant.
Wander, wandering thy tracks;
Just look at your splendor,
Only look at him in humility,
Be blissful only and sad!
Hear not my silent prayer,
Only consecrated to thy bliss;
Don't let me know, dear maid,
Highest star of splendour!
Only the most dignified of all
May your choices bring you delight,
And I will bless the high,
Many thousands of times.
Will I rejoice then and weep,
Blessed, blessed am I;
Should my heart break,
Brich, O heart, what is there to it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot grasp it, cannot believe,
A dream has obsessed me;
How would he, among all the others,
That lifts me up and makes me happy?
It was to me that he had spoken:
"I am yours forever"—
For me it was—I dreamed still,
It can never be like this.
Oh let me die in dreams,
Weighs on his breast,
Whispering the blissful death
In tears of endless delight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ringlet,
I press you piously to my lips,
Thy devotion to my heart.
I had dreamed of him,
The peaceful dream of childhood,
I found myself alone, lost
In desolate, infinite space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me
You opened my eyes
Of life's infinite, profound worth.
I will serve it and live for it,
Belongs entirely to Him,
To give myself and find
Enlightens me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden little ringlet,
I press you piously to my lips,
Thy devotion to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, my sisters,
Kindly adorn me,
The fortunate will serve me today,
Winds busily
Around my brow
Nor the blooming myrtle ornaments.
When I am satisfied,
Of a joyful heart,
Unless it lay in the arms of its lover,
Still he shouted
Longing in my heart,
Unhurried today.
Help me, my sisters,
Help me evaporate
A foolish anxiety,
That I with clear
Eye may receive him,
Him, the source of joyfulness.
You are, my lover,
You appeared to me,
Sun, do you give me your light?
Let me in reverence,
Let me in humility,
Let me bow to my master mine.
Scatters to him, sisters,
Scatters flowers to it,
Bring the budding roses to him,
But to you, sisters,
I greet with melancholy,
Joyfully departing from your crowd.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you are gazing
Astonishes me,
Can't you understand
How I can cry;
Let the damp pearls
Unfamiliar ornament
Trembling gaily bright
In my sight!
How so restless my bosom,
How so blissfully!
If I only knew in words
How shall I say it;
Come and bend your countenance
Here on my chest,
Will whisper in your ear
All my desire.
Do you know the tears now,
That I can cry for,
Shall you not see them
You, my dearest man?
Stay with my heart,
Feeling its blow,
That I, firm and firmer,
Only you may press.
Here on my bed
Does the cradle have room,
Where it silently hides
My sweet dream;
The morning will come,
Where dreams awaken,
And from this thy image
Laugh at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my breast,
My delight, my desire!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and I do not take it back.
Overwhelmingly esteemed myself,
But I am overjoyed now.
Only she who nurtures and loves
The child to whom it gives its nourishment;
Only a mother knows,
What love means and be happy.
Oh, how I mourn the man
The feeling of motherly bliss!
Dear, dear angel, you
You look at me and smile on me!
On my heart, on my breast,
My delight, my desire!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you have given me my first pain,
But he hit.
You sleep, you hard-hearted, merciless man,
The sleep of death.
The woman in the house is looking ahead,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
No longer alive.
I quietly retreat into my inner self,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost happiness,
O my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dream of your own days,
That now are far away,
Daughter of my daughter,
You, my sweet child,
Take, before the weariness
Covers the shroud,
Take to fresh life
My Word of Blessing.
See me grey with hair,
Banished and pale.
I have been, like you,
Young and blissful,
Love, as you love,
Were, like you, a bride,
And you too will grow old,
Just as I am saddened.
Let time fly
Going on and on,
Only sturdy and true
The horde of your bosom;
Once I told you,
I will not take it back:
Happiness is only love,
Love alone is happiness.
Than I, whom I loved,
Into the grave laid,
Do I have my love
Treated in me faithfully:
My heart was broken,
I still had the courage
And the ashes of old
Holds the holy fire.
Take, before the weariness
Covers the shroud,
Take to fresh life
My Word of Blessing:
If your heart has to break,
Your courage stay strong,
Be the pain of love
Then your highest good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There at night we kissed, O maidens,
No one was looking at us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We have dared the stars.
A star has fallen,
He who has sued the sea,
The sea has given it to the rudder,
The rudder to the pilot told.
There sang the same shipwrecked sailor
To his dearest.
Now they sing in streets and markets
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many times, in the circle of lovers,
Resting in the fragrant grass,
And sung a little song to me,
And all was pretty and good.
I have hardened, too, in loneliness
And had no sense or courage
But I came again to sing
All was also good again.
And some of the things I know
I bartered in silent woe,
But I came again to sing,
Was all also good again.
Do not moan for it long,
Whatever hurts you,
Just fresh, just fresh sung!
And everything will be fine again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may have wandered out in a sad hour,
Love wept so much,
My foot is lame, my shoulder hurts,
My heart is so heavy.
What are you singing, birds, in the dawn light?
You do not know how to part!
Sorrows and shoes do not press you;
Ye birds, ye have it well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
