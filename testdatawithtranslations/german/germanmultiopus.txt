I think yours,
When the sun shines on me
Beaming from the sea;
I think yours,
when the moon flickers
In Quellen malt.
I see you,
when on the far way
The dust rises,
In deep night,
when on the narrow bridge
The mover's shaking.
I hear you,
when there is a dull noise
The wave is rising.
In the still shark I often go to listen,
When everything's quiet.
I'm with you,
you are still so far away,
You're close to me!
The sun goes down,
Soon the stars will shine on me.
Oh, I wish you were there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the white light in the streets
bundles the city and the park
about the place where the summer is burned
There are sails of smoke.
we sacrifice your chastity first, dearest
and receive the forgiveness of the tongue for it
exhausted and dissolved lie the bodies
in the shadow of the speech
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And fresh food, new blood
I'm sucking from the free world:
Wie ist Natur so hold und gut,
Who's holding me up!
The wave weighs our boat
On the spur of the moment,
And mountains, cloudy sky,
Meet our run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye, my eye, what are you falling down on?
Golden dreams, are you coming back?
Gone, you dream! so gold you are:
Here is love and life.
On the wave shine a thousand floating stars,
Soft mist drinks the ring's stormy distance;
The morning winds sweep around The shady bay,
And in the lake, the ripening fruit reflects Himself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
supplementary longing takes place
when desire adds the one
what also the fulfilment, if it were, lacked.
as in the evening at the window in mixed light
the unknown is linked to the absolute
and the far is dissolved into the wide. I call:
I don't want anything I already know!
otherwise there are cold loneliness
so wie es in pariser restaurants kaltes huhn gibt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the Crucified One, this frog lay
Plate rolled on the hot asphalt
Der Landstraße. Offenen Mauls
Bow down to the sky, shattered by the sun,
Was von Fern einer Schuhsohle glich –
An amphibious from ancient Earth,
Under the wheels came in the jump.
No resurrection but in the larvae
The flies that will hatch tomorrow.
What is the opening through which the dream escapes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You feel a sense of emptiness
Something is gnawing at your insides
Filled with despair, you look around
How would you like to be another
Give yourself into our hands
We will transform you
without hesitation
in Ihr Gegenteil
You're tripping
We'll dry you out
They're rotten.
We stimulate your juices
You insist on being a man
We change your anatomy
They tend to be gentle
We'll put you in a rush
They shied away
We invert your gaze
You doubt
We fulfill you with certainty
You're scared.
We hang you
on your teeth
under the circus dome
You rest in yourself
We'll tear you to pieces
You breathe health
We contaminate you
Should in you
as a late follow-up
the desire to germinate
to be a man with his contradiction
rücken wir Sie dialektisch in die Mitte
The magicians and magnetisers of the house
are at your service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sister of the first light,
Image of tenderness in mourning!
Fog floats with silver showers
To your lovely face;
Your silent foot's running
Wake up from day-worn caves
Sadly estranged souls,
Me and the birds at night.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hardly in the wall, he was the middle,
fastened his radius
over the gardens, fields and hillsides
the chicken stalls, the radies-
chenbeet, became more comprehensive, mondial:
we hung up the shelter.
jackets and frames, hanging raincoats
And shielded us till we almost forgot him, whose hard gaze
will still be there when we've moved out
and city and house and street
vanished – so steadfastly far above,
so shining over the west and the east,
that you can navigate in the dark
after him, and old sailors a consolation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when October hung in the branches,
when it was time: we
pflückten quitten, wuchteten körbeweise gelb in die küche
underwater. ripen apples and pears
to her name, a plain sweet –
Other than the quince on its tree in the back corner
my alphabet, in the Latin of the garden,
hard and strange in their aroma. we cut,
quartered, gutted the meat (four large hands, two small),
schemenhaft im dampf des entsafters, gaben
sugar, heat, effort to something that
Roh dem Mund versagte. wer konnte, wollte quitten begreifen,
her gelee, in bauchigen gläsern für die
dark days in the shelves
rows, in a cellar of days, where they shined, shine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I sewed diamonds into your skirt so you could buy bread.
I put the sleeping animal in the backpack and a glass of jam with it, but psssst
I rolled your underwear under the sheet, you have to unpack it quickly
I stuffed the papers into this bag at the bottom, which I didn't, you know.
I embroidered a little money in the coat, maybe you can.
I've got Grandpa's watch in the vase by the window. Don't let them stop you.
I have a pen in this envelope and a letter attached to the uncle, give it to him.
I separated the star from the jacket, so it's better.
I burned all the stars, now every night is black
I guess I've given all the advice, now I don't have any.
I sewed diamonds into your skirt hem, but psssst
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I'm leaving this hut,
My dearest stay,
Wall with covered steps
Through the barren, dark forest:
Luna breaks through bush and oak,
Zephyr reports her run,
And the birches are scattered
Here's your sweet incense.
Wie ergötz’ ich mich im Kühlen
This beautiful summer night!
O how quiet it is to feel here,
What makes the soul happy!
Can't believe the delight,
Und doch wollt’ ich, Himmel, dir
Leave a thousand such nights,
If my girl had one for me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, it's the eyes again,
Who once so dearly greeted me,
And it's the lips again,
Who sweetened my life.
Auch die Stimme ist es wieder,
Who I once loved so much!
Only I'm not myself again,
I came home changed.
From the white, beautiful arms
Firm and lovingly enclosed,
Now I'm lying on her heart,
Dull senses and drooling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a star falling down
From his sparkling hide,
This is the star of love,
The one I see falling there.
They fall from the apple tree,
The white leaves so much,
There come the necking airs,
And play their game with it.
The swan sings in the pond,
And rows up and down,
And sinking ever softer,
He's diving into the grave of the flood.
It's so quiet and dark,
Verweht ist Blatt und Blüt’,
The star is whisperingly shattered,
Wrap up the swan song.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all the branches
Moving birds rise,
To sound far and wide in the air
If you listen to the travelling choir,
To the south, south
Into the everlasting flowers.
Your bird sings merrily,
We'll sing a merry tune,
When the Lenz comes,
Let's go back,
Back in nest and house,
From the south!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scattered with flourishing branches,
Cooled by playful vests,
Lag Rosilis am Bache hier
And Hylas next to her.
They sang jokes to each other,
She threw him with flowers, he again;
She bit him, he bit her,
Wer weiß wie lang’ und wie.
Touched by tenderness and love,
Ward made Hylas kiss.
He kissed her, he squeezed her.
That she cried out for help.
The mother came hurriedly and asked,
What the hell was Hylas doing here?
The daughter cried out: It is done,
You can go now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laziness, finally I need you
Sing a little praise, too.
Oh, how mad he's gotten at me,
Singing to your dignity!
Yes, I'll do my best,
It's good to rest after work.
Supreme goodness! Whoever has you,
His undisturbed life
Ach! ich gähn’ ich werde matt
Nun so magst du mir’s vergeben,
That I can't sing you;
You're stopping me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At midnight I went, not so much as I liked,
Little boy, to that churchyard
To the father's house of the priest, star by star,
They all shone too brightly;
At midnight.
If I then further into the depths of life
To her beloved she had to go, she must, because she was moving,
Star and northern light above me in strife,
I'm going, coming blessings sowed;
At midnight.
Until the end of the full moon
So clearly and distinctly I entered the darkness,
Also the thought willing, persistent, quick
Swing about the past as you would the future;
At midnight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to sneak to the doors,
I want to stand still and moral;
A righteous hand will provide sustenance,
And I'm gonna keep going.
Everyone will seem happy,
When My image appears before him;
He'll cry a tear,
And I don't know what he's crying about.
Whom God wills to give righteousness,
He sends it into the wide world,
He wants to show you his miracles
In mountain and forest and stream and field.
The tears that lie at home,
Do not revive the dawn,
They only know about the weighing of children,
Of sorrow, burden, and need for bread.
The streams leap from the mountains,
The larks whirl high in lust,
Was sollt’ ich nicht mit ihnen singen
From a full throat and a fresh chest.
I only let the dear God reign;
The stream, the lark, wind and the field,
Und Erd’ und Himmel will erhalten,
Hat auch mein Sach’ aufs Best’ bestellt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the lightning red
Here come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
Nobody knows me there anymore.
How soon, alas, how soon comes the silent time,
There I also rest, and above me
The beautiful loneliness of the forest,
And nobody knows me here anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your picture is wonderful
Hab’ ich im Herzensgrund,
Das sieht so frisch und fröhlich
Me an zu jeder Stund’.
My heart sings silently in itself
An old, beautiful song,
Das in die Luft schwinget
And hurries to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's already late, it is already cold,
What are you riding through the woods?
The forest is long, you're alone,
You beautiful bride! I'll take you home!
“Great is the man’s deceit and cunning,
With pain my heart is broken,
Probably the forest horn wandered back and forth,
O flee! Thou knowest not who I am."
So richly adorned is the male and the female,
So beautiful the young body,
Now I know you—God help me!
You're the witch Loreley.
“You know me well—from high stone
Look quietly my castle deep into the Rhine.
It's already late, it is already cold,
Don’t ever come out of this forest!”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It knows and advises none,
How well I am, how well!
Ach, wüßt’ es nur Einer, nur Einer,
Don't let anybody else know!
It’s not so quiet out in the snow,
So silent and silent
Die Sterne nicht in der Höh’,
When my thoughts are.
I wish I was a bird
And stretch forth over the sea,
Prosperous across the sea and beyond,
Until I was in heaven’!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Es war, als hätt’ der Himmel,
The earth kissed silently,
That in the shimmering of its blossoms
You just have to dream about him.
The air went through the fields,
The ears grew soft,
The forests whispered,
The night was so clear.
And my soul
Far are their wings,
Flew through the still lands,
Like she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The apples are singing and the trees are shivering,
Als machten zu dieser Stund’
Around the half-sunk walls
Die alten Götter die Rund’.
Behind the myrtle trees
In secretly dazzling splendor,
What are you talking about, like in dreams,
To me, fantastic night?
All the stars are shining on me
With burning eyes of love,
It talks drunken the distance
Like future great fortune!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleeping on the Lauer
The old knight is at the top;
Clouds go down, rain showers,
And the forest roars through the grid.
Grown-up beard and hair,
And petrifies the chest and the throat,
Sitting many hundreds of years
Up in the silent Klause.
Outside it's quiet and peaceful,
All are drawn to the valley,
Birds of the woods singing lonely
Into the empty arch of the window.
A wedding rides down there
Auf dem Rhein im Sonnenscheine,
Musicians play lively,
And the beautiful bride crying.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ich hör’ die Bächlein rauschen
In the woods, back and forth,
In the forest, in the noise
I don't know where I am.
Die Nachtigallen schlagen
Here in solitude,
As if they wanted to say something
From the good old days.
The moonlight flies,
As I look under me
The castle lies in the valley,
And it's so far from here!
As if in the garden
Full of white and red roses,
My darlings are waiting for me,
And he's been dead so long.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I can sing sometimes,
As if I'm happy,
But secretly there are tears,
I'll have my heart set free.
They leave nightingales,
Plays outside spring air,
The longing to sound the song
From her dungeon crypt.
There all hearts are listening,
Und alles ist erfreut,
But no one feels the pain,
In the song the deep sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dämmrung will spread the wings,
The trees are trembling,
Clouds move like heavy dreams
What does this Graun mean?
Love one deer before another,
Don't let it graze alone,
Hunters move in the woods and blow,
Voices wander back and forth.
Do you have a friend here,
Do not trust him at this hour,
Kindly with eyes and mouth,
He feels war in peace of mind.
What are you tired of today?
She'll be born again tomorrow.
Some things are lost in the night...
Be careful, stay awake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a wedding on the mountain,
I heard the birds beating,
And many riders blew, and the horn of the forest sounded,
That was a fun hunt!
Und eh’ ich’s gedacht, war alles verhallt,
The night covers the round;
Only from the mountains the forest still roars
Und mich schauert’s im Herzensgrunde.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the garden through the air
When I hear migratory birds,
That means spring scents,
Below it already starts to bloom.
I want to cry
Ist mir's doch, als könnt't sein!
Old miracles seem again
Come in with the moonlight.
Und der Mond, die Sterne sagen’s,
Und im Traume rauscht’s der Hain
Und die Nachtigallen schlagen’s:
She is yours, she is thine!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When all the woods were asleep,
He started digging,
Restless in the depths of mountains
He was digging for a treasure.
The angels of God sang
Meanwhile, in the still night,
How red eyes penetrated
Metals from the shaft.
“And become mine!”, and grimmer
Squeeze and squish!
There fall down stones and debris
Down on the fool.
Laughing wildly
From the decayed tomb,
Der Engelsang verhallte
Weeping in the air!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Es zogen zwei rüst’ge Gesellen
For the first time from home,
So rejoicing right into the bright,
Ringing, singing waves
Out of the full spring.
Those who strove for high things,
They wanted, in spite of lust and pain,
Was Recht’s in der Welt vollbringen,
And whomsoever they passed by,
The laughing mind and heart.
The first one who found a sweetheart,
The son-in-law buys’ the yard and the house;
He soon weighed a bundle,
And looked out of a secret place
Comfortably out into the field.
The second sang and lied
The thousand voices in the ground,
Tempting’ sirens, and pulled
Into the shimmering waves,
In the waves colored throat.
And as he emerges from the throat,
Then he was tired and old,
His little ship that lay in the bottom,
So still war’s rings in der Runde,
Und über dem Wasser weht’s kalt.
The waves are singing and ringing
May the spring be upon me;
Und seh’ ich so kecke Gesellen,
The tears in my eye...
Ach, Gott, führ’ uns liebreich zu Dir!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come, comfort of the world, you silent night!
How thou goest down from the mountains smoothly,
The airs all sleep,
A sailor only, wandering tired’,
Sing his evening song over the sea
To God's praise in the harbor.
The years go by like the clouds
And let me stand here lonely,
The world has forgotten me,
Then you came to me beautifully,
When I hear the noise of the woods
Sitting thoughtfully.
O comfort of the world, you silent night!
The day made me so tired,
The wide sea is already dark,
Let me rest from lust and want,
Until the eternal dawn
Sparking through the silent forest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From home behind the lightning red
Here come the clouds,
But father and mother are long dead,
Nobody knows me there anymore.
How soon, alas, how soon comes the silent time,
There I also rest, and above me
The beautiful loneliness of the forest,
And nobody knows me here anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Es war, als hätt’ der Himmel,
The earth kissed silently,
That in the shimmering of its blossoms
You just have to dream about him.
The air went through the fields,
The ears grew soft,
The forests whispered,
The night was so clear.
And my soul
Far are their wings,
Flew through the still lands,
Like she was flying home.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welsh country lau and blue,
Ging’ ich mit der Mandoline
Durch die überglänzte Au’.
In der Nacht das Liebchen lauschte
An dem Fenster süß verwacht,
Wünschte mir und ihr, uns beiden,
Have a nice night.
When the sun shines sweetly
As in Welsh country lau and blue,
Ging’ ich mit der Mandoline
Durch die überglänzte Au’.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Past is the bright day,
From afar comes the sound of the bell;
So time travels all night,
Take some people with you who didn’t think so.
Where then is the colorful lust,
The friend's comfort and faithful chest,
The sweetest eyeliner?
Doesn't anybody want to talk to me?
Fresh up, dear Nightingale,
You waterfall with a bright sound!
Let's praise God together,
Until the bright morning dawns!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She must have been standing by the window
And wore her sad hair,
The hunter had gone away,
The hunter was her favorite.
And when the spring came,
The world was covered with blossoms,
Then she took a heart
Und ging in die grüne Heid’.
She puts her ear to the lawn,
Hear also the sound of hoofs –
These are the deer that graze
On the shady mountainside.
And in the evening the forests roar,
There's only one shot from a distance.
She's standing there, listening quietly.
“That was my dearest greeting!”
And springs gushed forth from the rock,
Then the birds fled into the valley.
“And when you meet him, you companions,
O, greet him a thousand times!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High above still heights
There was a house in the forest;
So einsam war’s zu sehen,
Beyond the forest.
A girl sat in it
By the stillness of evening,
Stitch silk threads
To her wedding dress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and look,
In field and forest and valley,
From the mountain down to the plain;
Much beauty, high lady,
I greet you a thousand times.
In meinem Garten find’ ich
Viel’ Blumen, schön und fein,
Viel’ Kränze wohl draus wind’ ich
Und tausend Gedanken bind’ ich
And greetings with it.
I can't give you one,
She's too tall and pretty,
You must all be silent,
The love only unparalleled
Stay in the heart forever.
Ich schein’ wohl froher Dinge
Und schaffe auf und ab,
And if the heart breaks,
I dig forth and sing,
Und grab’ mir bald mein Grab.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lindes Rauschen in den Wipfeln,
The bird that flies far away from you,
Bronns from the still peaks,
Tell me where my home is.
Today in the dream I saw her again,
And from all the mountains went
Such a greeting to me,
That I started crying.
Ah! here on the strange summits:
People, springs, rock and tree -
Everything is like a dream to me!
Monstrous birds in the ivory towers,
Your companions there in the valley,
Greet me from the strange summits
My homeland a thousand times!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wherever I go and look,
In field and forest and valley,
From the hill to the meadow,
From the mountain up far into the blue:
Grüss’ ich dich tausend mal.
In meinem Garten find’ ich
Lots of beautiful and fine flowers;
A lot of wreaths I’m winding from,
Und tausend Gedanken bind’ ich,
And greetings with that.
I can't give you one,
You're too tall and beautiful,
You have to fade too soon,
Love without equals
Stay in the heart forever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it were dark, I'd lie in the forest,
In the forest it roars so softly,
With her starry coat
Cover me there the night,
There come the streams gone,
Do I have to go to sleep?
Ich schlaf’ nicht, ich hör’ noch lang
To the nightingales,
When the dots are swaying over me,
It's ringing all night,
These are the thoughts in the heart,
They sing when no one's watching.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me read deep in you,
Do not hide this from me,
What a magical creature
Speaks from your voice!
There are so many words
Ans Ohr uns ohne Plan
And while they groan,
It's all gone!
But it's only pushing from a distance
Your tone to me,
I love him so much,
I forget him so hard.
I'll be crying then, delirious
From allzurascher Glut:
My heart and your voice
Understand each other too well!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I get up in the night?
And I felt drawn,
I left the alleys guarded by a guard,
Transformed soft
Night, night,
The gate with the Gothic arch.
The Mühlbach rushing through rocky shaft,
I leaned over the bridge,
Deep below me I took care of the waves,
Die wallten so sacht
Night, night,
But there was not a back.
It turned upside down, lit innumerable
Melody of the stars,
With them the moon in restful splendor,
They sparkled softly
Night, night,
By deceptively remote distance.
I looked up at night, in the night
And looked down upon the new;
O woe, how hast thou spent the days
Now quiet you soft,
Night, night,
Repentance in the beating heart!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sneaking around
Desolate and mute,
You ask, o ask
Not me, why?
The heart is shaking
So many punishments!
And can I ever
Too gloomy?
The tree withers,
The scent vanishes,
The leaves are lying
So yellow in the bed,
It's raining
With power come in,
And can I ever
Too gloomy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is the stream that blew up next to me?
The bird whose song I listened to, where is he now?
Wo ist die Rose, die die Freundin am Herzen trug,
And that kiss that intoxicated me, where is it now?
And that man, whom I have been, and whom
I switched with someone else. Where is he now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're saying I was wrong,
Proclaim it high and lofty,
I know you loved,
But you don't love anymore!
Your beautiful eye was burning,
The kisses were burning,
You loved me, confess it,
But you don't love anymore!
I don't count on new ones,
faithful return;
Just pretend that you loved,
And don't love me anymore!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love has lied,
The worry weighs heavy,
Betrayed, oh!
It's all around me!
It pours bright drops
The cheek always down,
Let it go, let it knock,
Let go, my dear, let go!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My heart is torn, you don't love me!
You let me know you don't love me!
Though I appeared to you pleading and soliciting,
And loveflies, you don't love me!
You spoke it, you said it in words,
With all due knowledge, you don't love me!
So shall I make the stars, and the moon,
Miss the sun? You don't love me!
The rose blossoms for me, the jasmine blooms,
What's with the daffodils? You don't love me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My eye is cloudy, my mouth is mute,
You call me talking, that's why!
Your eye is clear, your mouth is red,
And whatever you want, it's a commandment.
My hair is grey, my heart is sore,
You're so young and so healthy!
You call me talk and make it so hard for me.
I look at you and shake so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
As in watchful dreams
His image floats before me,
Dive out of the deepest darkness,
Lighter up.
Otherwise it is light- and colourless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
I don't want any more,
I'd rather cry,
Silent in the chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so gentle, how so good!
Holde lips, clear eye,
Bright mind and firm courage.
So wie dort in blauer Tiefe,
Bright and glorious, that star,
So he's in my sky,
Bright and glorious, lofty and distant.
Wave, wander your paths;
Just look at your appearance,
Just look at him in humility,
Bless you and be sad!
Don't listen to my silent prayer,
Blessed be Thy fortune.
Darfst mich niedre Magd nicht kennen,
High star of glory!
Only the most worthy of all
May your choices be blessed,
And I will bless the high,
Many thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and weep,
Blessed be I then;
If my heart were to break,
Brich, o Herz, was liegt daran?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ich kann’s nicht fassen, nicht glauben,
It was a dream that moved me;
How could he be among all
Raise me poor and happy?
Mir war’s, er habe gesprochen:
“I am yours forever”—
Mir war’s— ich träume noch immer,
It can never be like that.
O let me die in the dream,
Weighed on his chest,
"Blessed be my death"
In tears of endless lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden wreath,
I'll squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
I dreamt of him,
Childhood peacefully beautiful dream,
I found myself alone, lost
In the barren, endless space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me,
Hast meinem Blick erschlossen
Life's infinite, profound value.
I want to serve him, to live with him.
To Him belong all,
Hin selbst mich geben und finden
Enlighten me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden wreath,
I'll squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Kindly decorate me,
Serves the fortunate today to me,
Windet bustling
Me around the butt
Still the blooming myrtle ornament.
When I'm satisfied,
With a joyful heart,
Or lay in the arms of the beloved,
He was still shouting,
longing in the heart,
Impatient today.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me escape
A foolish apprehension,
Dass ich mit klarem
Receive him,
The source of joy.
Are you, my beloved,
You appeared to me,
Will you shine your light on me, sun?
Let me pray,
Let me humble myself,
Let me bow to the lord mine.
Scatter him, sisters,
Scatters him flowers,
Bring him bountiful roses,
But to you, sisters,
Greetings with sadness,
Joyfully departing from your company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
I'm surprised.
Can't you see?
How I can cry;
Leave the damp pearls
Unusual ornamentation
Frequently shivering brightly
In the eye of me!
How so frightened my bosom,
How delicious!
If I only knew in words,
Wie ich’s sagen soll;
Come and hold your face
Here on my chest,
Will in’s Ohr dir flüstern
All my pleasure.
Do you know the tears,
Die ich weinen kann,
Don't you want to see her,
You beloved man?
Stay by my heart,
Feel its blow,
That I'm firm and firmer
You're the only one who likes to squeeze.
Here on my bed
Does the cradle have room,
Where she hides silently
My sweet dream;
The morning will come,
Wo der Traum erwacht,
And from it your image
Smile at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On my heart, on my chest,
My delight, my lust!
Happiness is love, love is happiness,
I said it and I won’t take it back.
I have overestimated myself,
But I'm overjoyed now.
♪ Only she who sucks, only she that loves
The child to whom she feeds;
Only a mother knows alone,
What it means to love and be happy.
O, wie bedaur’ ich doch den Mann,
Who can't feel his mother's happiness!
Dear, dear angel, you
You look at me and smile at it!
On my heart, on my chest,
My delight, my lust!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you've done me the first pain,
But he did.
You're asleep, you hard, ruthless man,
The sleep of death.
Es blicket die Verlassne vor sich hin,
The world is empty.
I have loved and lived, I am
Not alive anymore.
I retreat quietly into my innres,
The veil falls,
There I have you and my lost fortune,
You my world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adorned with the myrtle and the bridal gown,
The guard's daughter, the rosy maid
Enter the lion's den; it lies
The mistress at his feet, in front of whom he drowns.
The mighty, fierce and unrelenting before,
Look up to your mistress with devotion and understanding;
The Virgin, delicate and full of fragrance,
Love him gently and weep at the same time:
“As were in days that are no more,
Even faithful games, like child and child,
And loved us, and liked us;
The days of childhood, they are far away.
“You shook powerfully, eh’ we’s believed,
Your queen-sized royal head;
I grew up, you see: I am
The child no longer with a childish sense.
“Oh, if I were the child and stayed with you,
My strong, faithful, righteous beast;
But I must follow, they did it to me,
Out into the stranger's strange man.
"It occurred to him that I was beautiful,
I was freed, it's over now:
The wreath in the hair, my good fellow,
And before tears not the eyes more bright.
“Do you understand me completely?
I'm ready, don't worry about it.
There I see him coming, whom I must follow,
So, friend, I give you the last kiss!”
And as the girl's lips touched him,
One could feel the cage tremble,
And when he sees the young man at the kennel,
The frightened bride is terrified.
He stands at the door of the kennel,
He swings the tail, he roars with power;
Praying, commanding, and threatening
Out; he guards the way out in anger.
And there's a lot of screaming out there.
The young man calls out: “Bring weapons;
I shot him down, I hit him good!”
The angry one screams with shameful rage.
The wicked dares to approach the door,
Then he turns on the mistress:
The beautiful figure, a hideous robbery,
Lying bloodstained, disfigured in the dust.
And how they shed the precious blood,
He lies on his dead body with dark courage,
He lies so overwhelmed in sorrow and pain,
Until the bullet kills him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky is clear and blue,
The ripening is a show of flowers.
There's a shimmering flower by the window.
A young man stands in front, looking at him.
And behind the flowers blossoms
A blue, smiling pair of eyes.
Marchioness, like the one I haven't seen.
The ripeness is smothered and crushed.
Ice flowers begin to melt,
And may God have mercy on the young man.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mother prays with her heart and looks
Delighted to see the sleepy little boy.
He rests in the cradle so gently and confidently.
He must be an angel to her.
She's kissing him and hearts him, she can barely hold on.
Forgetting the earthly pain,
Their dream of hope is wafting into the future.
That's how mothers dream in their hearts.
The raven, however, will be with the Sippschaft
Outside the window, there's a whirlwind:
Your angel, your angel will be ours!
The robber serves us for food!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It goes with muted drum sound;
How far away is the place! How long the road!
Oh, he'd be quiet and all over!
I think it's tearing my heart apart.
Ich hab’ in der Welt nur ihn geliebt,
Only him, who's being given death.
When the game is ringing, there will be a parade,
That's what I'm in charge of.
Now he's looking up for the last time
In God's bright sunshine,
Now they close their eyes to him,
God grant you eternal rest!
It must have been nine of them,
Eight bullets have passed;
They're all trembling with grief and pain...
But I met him in the heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the small town there is a lot of cheering,
There they hold wedding with dance and with game,
The happy one's wine is so red,
The bride's just like a dying man.
Yes, dead to him whom she does not forget,
Who is not a bridegroom at the feast,
There he stands in the midst of the guests,
And stroke the violin funny enough!
He strokes the violin, his hair turns gray,
The strings are swinging, yellow and loud,
He presses it to the heart and does not consider it,
I don't care if it breaks into a thousand pieces.
It's awful when someone dies like that.
When a young man's heart is still full of joy;
I don't want to see it anymore!
That would make my head spin spinning.—
Who told you to point your fingers at me?
O God, have mercy on us,
That none is driven by madness,
I'm a poor musician myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind;
Wherever I look,
I see him alone;
As in watchful dreams
His image floats before me,
Dive out of the deepest darkness,
Lighter up.
Otherwise it is light- and colourless
All around me,
After the Sisters Games
I don't want any more,
I'd rather cry,
Silent in the chamber;
Ever since I saw him,
I think I'm blind.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He, the most glorious of all,
How so gentle, how so good!
Holde lips, clear eye,
Bright mind and firm courage.
So wie dort in blauer Tiefe,
Bright and glorious, that star,
So he's in my sky,
Bright and glorious, lofty and distant.
Wave, wander your paths;
Just look at your appearance,
Just look at him in humility,
Bless you and be sad!
Don't listen to my silent prayer,
Blessed be Thy fortune.
Darfst mich niedre Magd nicht kennen,
High star of glory!
Only the most worthy of all
May your choices be blessed,
And I will bless the high,
Many thousands of times.
Will I then rejoice and weep,
Blessed be I then;
If my heart were to break,
Brich, o Herz, was liegt daran?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ich kann’s nicht fassen, nicht glauben,
It was a dream that moved me;
How could he be among all
Raise me poor and happy?
Mir war’s, er habe gesprochen:
“I am yours forever”—
Mir war’s— ich träume noch immer,
It can never be like that.
O let me die in the dream,
Weighed on his chest,
"Blessed be my death"
In tears of endless lust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You ring on my finger,
My golden wreath,
I'll squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
I dreamt of him,
Childhood peacefully beautiful dream,
I found myself alone, lost
In the barren, endless space.
You ring on my finger
That's when you taught me,
Hast meinem Blick erschlossen
Life's infinite, profound value.
I want to serve him, to live with him.
To Him belong all,
Hin selbst mich geben und finden
Enlighten me in its splendor.
You ring on my finger,
My golden wreath,
I'll squeeze you piously on the lips,
Devote yourself to my heart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help me, you sisters,
Kindly decorate me,
Serves the fortunate today to me,
Windet bustling
Me around the butt
Still the blooming myrtle ornament.
When I'm satisfied,
With a joyful heart,
Or lay in the arms of the beloved,
He was still shouting,
longing in the heart,
Impatient today.
Help me, you sisters,
Help me escape
A foolish apprehension,
Dass ich mit klarem
Receive him,
The source of joy.
Are you, my beloved,
You appeared to me,
Will you shine your light on me, sun?
Let me pray,
Let me humble myself,
Let me bow to the lord mine.
Scatter him, sisters,
Scatters him flowers,
Bring him bountiful roses,
But to you, sisters,
Greetings with sadness,
Joyfully departing from your company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet friend, you look
I'm surprised.
Can't you see?
How I can cry;
Leave the damp pearls
Unusual ornamentation
Frequently shivering brightly
In the eye of me!
How so frightened my bosom,
How delicious!
If I only knew in words,
Wie ich’s sagen soll;
Come and hold your face
Here on my chest,
Will in’s Ohr dir flüstern
All my pleasure.
Do you know the tears,
Die ich weinen kann,
Don't you want to see her,
You beloved man?
Stay by my heart,
Feel its blow,
That I'm firm and firmer
You're the only one who likes to squeeze.
Here on my bed
Does the cradle have room,
Where she hides silently
My sweet dream;
The morning will come,
Wo der Traum erwacht,
And from it your image
Smile at me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My delight, my lust!

Dream of your own days,
Those who are far off,
Daughter of my daughter,
You my sweet child,
Take it before you get tired
Cover the shroud,
Take into the fresh life
My blessing.
See me gray with hair,
Dishonored and pale.
Bin, wie du, gewesen
Young and rich,
Love, as you love,
Ward, like you, also bride,
And you too will grow old,
Just like I blush.
Let time fly
Moving on and on,
Only consistently true
Thy bosom's horn;
Hab ich’s einst gesprochen,
I won’t take it back:
Happiness is only love,
Love is only happiness.
When I, whom I loved,
Into the grave,
Do I have my love
Loyally cherished in me:
Was my heart broken,
The courage remained with me,
And the ashes of old age
Hold the bonfire.
Take it before you get tired
Cover the shroud,
Take into the fresh life
My blessing:
If your heart has to break,
Hold on to your courage,
Be the pain of love
Then your highest possession.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we kissed at night, o girl,
Nobody was watching us.
The stars that stood in the sky,
We trusted the stars.
A star has fallen,
He accused the sea of us,
There the sea has it to roar,
The rudder told the sailor.
The same sailor sang
To his beloved.
Nun singen’s auf Straßen und Märkten
The boys and girls in the choir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hab’ oft im Kreise der Lieben
Resting in fragrant grass,
And sing me a song,
And everything was nice and good.
Hab’ einsam auch mich gehärmet
And had no sense
But I came to sing again
Everything was fine again.
And some of what I'm learning,
Verkocht’ ich in stiller Wuth,
But I came to sing again,
Everything was fine again.
So don't complain long,
Whatever hurts you,
Just fresh, just freshly sung!
And everything's gonna be okay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll wander off in sad sadness,
Love wept so much,
My foot is lame, my shoulder hurts,
The heart, it's so hard for me.
What do you birds sing in the morning light?
You don't know how to divorce!
You are not burdened with worries and shoes;
You birds, you got it!
