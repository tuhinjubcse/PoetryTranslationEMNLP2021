this little island drilled underwater by American submarines,
where my great-grandfather planted vines and citrus
He built stables and brought ten cows from the Continent.
Their trembling hooves on the boat, the wind on their backs
until then only hit by the northern rains.
They're still there, the sand-mixed horns
the deep skeletons, close to the rocks
No more fear, no more distinction between pastures and the sea.

Because evil is like the cricket buried in a shoe box in the soil of the garden.
'Cause I'm getting the creeps for others tonight.
I see her, this woman who stared at the television for hours

at the exact point where death began: the unnecessary indigestion, the burning body,
of the hunter on his side.
Close your eyes. Think: leprechaun, and fox and wolf call the beasts that hunt run on the earth
and I am in the wave of dying or falling asleep, drowning in a hole where only those who are
pursued really knows the night really the breath.

Round, icy of its oceans, transparent
as a cell under the microscope
but horizontally with mountains set high above the meadows
with the tongue of the rivers and the low sea.
I only sometimes suspect vertigo:
We spin faster. Sleeping I scream “cado”
And there I feel space, black, stars on my neck
The scare that vomits itself into a thousand balls.

"Oh, that's hell," you say, and you fall asleep.
Meditating on hell then. Just move the weight of the tent
I see exactly:
A line of ants, their march, the great starry night.
I try to take hell for a limb
(a little black, the emptiness, fear)
to make it swirl in the courtyard so that the beetles will roar to the sky
to be the insect that I have always been:
that is born and is forgotten in the air.

It's an increase.

I saw you in a dream.
that you ran into me
surprised and satisfied
to have found me,
I'm happy too
While you're listening
that you knew me
persuaded of deceit
and that the transport
It was mostly mine.
And in the crystal

It was, in the meantime,
I kissed you against a yellow wall

Central Park, late autumn, trees
Of electric silk and blood-coloured
in the cool azure of the sky rising

then slowly they disappear,

that's coming, air
It's getting dark.
And the crown begins to shine
Skyscraper ice cream

Thirty-year-old greys.
But she dancing moves the ash of her head
and the unthinkable heavenly eyes
makes a magic circle
in Manhattan, it's starting a fire.

Of all the species that exist
They imagined a thousand paths
filaments of millions of colors
which they carried from one place to another,
from a paradise to a continent, a mountain,
from millions of generations to deeds

to transitions, to oscillating a glass
of walls that float to and fro
They're making a lot of noise. Insecticide.
Melagranate light that tells them,
in the crash with which they announce their panic
so the splash of that water and its end that soon

Don't be a member, I'm not.

Then I climbed a mountain,
Peopled in principle, over there deserted,

You've finished the city.
Trieste has a quarrelsome
grace. If you like,
He's like an abrasive, voracious little boy,
with blue eyes and too big hands
to give a flower;
as a love
with jealousy.
From this mountain every church, every street
I find, if I go to the shady beach,
or to the hill where, on the banks,

a wandering balloon turkey

the sky is never as clear and cold
Midday shining winter.
Heaven with some white clouds,
and the windows of the houses on the ground burning,
and the smoke of one of the two paths,
and on all things, the divine
things, that globe from the hand of a stray boy
(He surely wept in the midst of the crowd his pain, his great pain)

Beyond the glasses I gazed with gleaming eyes

In my youth I sailed
along the Dalmatian coast.
Wave-flavored isolates emerged, where rare
a bird that lay in wait for prey,
covered with algae, floating, in the sun
Beautiful as emeralds.
When the high tide and the night overwhelmed them,
Sails under the breeze wandered further ashore,
to avoid the insurrection.
Today, my kingdom is nobody's land.
The harbor turns its lights on to others,
me al largo
still suspends the unmolested spirit,
and of life the painful love
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know a better hour of the day than the night?
so much more beautiful and less beloved?
It is the one who soon precedes his holy ears;
the hour that intense is the work,
and you see people floating in the streets;
on the square moles of the houses
a swollen moon, one that just
discern in the still air.
It's time for you to leave the country
to enjoy your dear city,
From the luminous gulf to the mountains
it varies in its fine unity;
the time when my life is full
Like a river to its sea;
and my thought, the lest I walk
of the crowd, the craftsmen at the top
stairs, the boy who jumps running
On the dazzling carriage, everything appears

He's got a sense of immobility.
It's the big time, the time that accompanies
Better our seventy-first birthday.

Rome is an unforgettable calm mother.

The world is darkened, and it is renewed by the Jews.
That's all the old man smiles at me in the sun.

of you, in the dark at the door, words.

With your little bestial eyes
Look at me and shut up and wait and then squeeze
And look at me and shut up.
Goofy and heavy slumbering
In the primordial dreams, a prostitute.
Who called you to life? Where are you from?
From the trees you bring thyrrh,
From the singing fairs of Tuscany
Or in the scorching sands? Was your mother under the spires?
The immensity impresses you with the astonishment
In the face of the wounded sphinx
The burning breath of life
Tragically, like a lion, you're losing your black heifer.
And you look at the sacred blond angel
That does not love you and doesn’t love and that suffers
About you and how I'm tired of kissing you.

Distant birds open in the evening

the contempt, the winning Christian pity,
and this naked pain.
You have a coral flower on your hair.
But your face is a shadow that does not change;
(so it kills). From the dark houses
I hear the showers and the rain from your village,
or perhaps a trembling of human steps,
Between the holds of the banks.

And if my joy wins you,
It's a shadow node.
It's no longer a consolation.

Turn the light on its heavens
at the edge of the darkness.
Motion of stars and of stillness
He throws us a night in the rapid deception:
stones that water splashes on every seal.
Children still sleep in your sleep;
I even hear a scream sometimes
break and make flesh;
and beat hands and a voice
Unknown sweets.
