this little island built by the submerged Americans,
Wherein my lord lamented viti and herbage
he built a stand and carried ten gallons from the Continent.
Their wrists on the bark, the wind on their backs
Blown until then only by the north rain.
I’m still there, the twisted horns mixed with sand
the deep shrouds, close to the crags
No more fear, no more distinction between the pastures and the sea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That evil may be wielded like a bush in the garden bed.
That to me tonight may come the fear of others.
I see it, this woman who for hours has fixed the television on
And now cries against another body in shadow
motionless on the colorless armchair.
Accept this silence: the word streaked in the darkness of the throat like an irrigated beast, like the
a pilgrim’s gilded shield that gleamed in the October storms. Livid and mingled with
paglia, the dry heart, without smoke, and yet against the lightning that closed the door, every time
at the exact moment death was begun: the unconscious indigestion, the burning body
of the hunter’s side.
Close your eyes. Think: lion, and wolf and oxen race on the earth
pearls and are stranded on the shore of dying or asleep in the tana where only he is
Inseguied knows truly the night really the breath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The word, for me,
Came from afar.
A prioris, almost,
the vertivity. An eccitation.
In a dispute
some way inversely.
In giving it as a counterpoint
a reality that instead
More touched and pressed, more
It escaped inconsistently
to five senses.
With the effect of being
thrown against a body
Uttered, and, in the
his telling, suddenly
retraced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many times
I have gone away
as soon as day or
in the night's heart
And many controversies
in the finite disdain
with the head
on the return's doorstep.
If we could sum up
one by one
all the cracks
and add the places
like a leaf by leaflet
As a long leap from which a chain is drawn,
That most horrible deed
of distance
would be reflected in the sum
on the sheets.". "
Would be the proof
of a condemnation
without any rest,
Would be seen
that does not advance
of a span,
that is the way
and less is found,
that does not come
anywhere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Round, frozen of its oceans, transparent
like a cell under a microscope
yet horizontal with mountains flattened steadily on the meadows
with the tongues of rivers and the sea stepped.
Only at times I fear the trembling:
We turn more swiftly. Weeping I scream “take”
and there I feel space, black, stars on the nape
The terror that smiteth itself in a thousand spheres.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh that is Hell,” you say and awake.
Writ on hell then. Just let the weight of the tent move
Making the panels run along the glass. I see precisely:
a line of butterflies, their march, the great night of stars.
I take in Hell as a garland
(a bit of black, the void, and the fear)
in the hall because the acorns wheel to the sky
to be the enemy I’ve always been:
born and forgotten in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not call him, he comes
In its semilunescent force,
it’s already a part of your smile
like the scent of the woods,
a niente, the snout suddenly
of the leprosy, it’s already a creak
in your hands, sits
on the throne that becomes.
It's an increase
that has no mismatch of clouds,
it makes me afraid like the beginning of the wind
that bends not its branches but revives its colors.
My love beautiful and full of suffering,
His imprint is already in our power
form. Happiness
it's the waiting, the time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The quilted toaster in the white light.
And in the evening.
It would be enough to see
that it is evening,
to see it on all the tables
of the condo
half insufficient for breakfast
or sharpened with on the remote
reflected in the spent video.
It would be like the mouths closed without glass
to open -
of scatto
Would rise to beg
beating on the table
and on the plateaued bone of loneliness.
So many men would be seen,
many men with heads bent, with tongues gross,
silent on video, in the white light before the evening.
His caper's snout in the spring
Would put to burn in those hands, confident.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw you in a dream
you who were running to catch me
surprise and satisfied
to have found myself,
I am happy too
is only sensing
you knew me
persuaded by the deception
and that the transport
was soprattuttous mine.
And in crystal
of my own vision
by way of nose
it has been, meanwhile,
I kissed you against a yellow wall
Holding your scent between your arms.
I awake in melancholy
took hold of me and burned in me all day long,
but I did not want to let him be, staying in the kitchen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Park, autumn, trees
of electric silk and colored like blood
in the blue sky’s warm yellow frost
open up
Then slowly they cease,
shadow
that’s coming, air
that obscures itself.
And begins to shine the crown
ice of the penthouses
on the crowd most filthy in the streets.
I ask Oonagh: why do you keep your hair
grey for three hundred years.
But she singing moves the ashes of the head
And the celestial eyes impensable
make a magic circle
in Manhattan, makes of itself a fire
and opens arms, arrows, wings,
into the ocean of evening voices.
Feel as if it's a scream of barefoot barks.
Into the black sea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all those species that exist
they imagined a thousand miles away,
filaments of millions of colours
Which from one place to another carried,
from paradise to a continent, a mountain,
from millions of generations to the acts
Of generations, to more like them,
to transitions, to oscillating a glass
Of walls that, ever changing from repose
Above a tree-shadow they sound insectivora
The melagranate light that tells them,
in the horn that signals for their terror
So likewise the flow of that water and its ending soon
will never match like this
Not being a member, I am not.

I have traversed all of the city.
Then I climbed an errand,
A nation at its beginning, then deserted,
close by a little door:
a hole in which only
I sit, and it seems to me that where it ends
terminates the city.
Trieste has a controversy
grace. If it please you,
it's like a greedy and stubborn girl,
With blue eyes and hands too large
to give a flower;
like a love
with rage.
From this embankment every church, its way
if it leads to a shaded slope,
Or to the hill from which, upon the swallowed
a top, a house, the last, lies upon it.
Round about
circling everything
a strange atmosphere, a tormented air,
the native air.
My city that on every side is alive,
Has made the hole for me, for my life
thoughtful and thoughtless.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment when they were already happy
(God, for this great and tremendous word, pardon me). Who brought my brief lamentation to tears?
You will say: “Remember
A beautiful creature passing yonder,
And smiled at thee." A pallon instead,
a wandering little turtle
in the blue of the air, and the native
Never as in the clear and cold sky
a glowing midnight in the Northern hemisphere.
Sky with a few white clouds,
And the windows in the sunlit houses flaming,
And the thick smoke of one two compartments,
And on all things, the divine
That globe, from the hand of an escaped child
(he certainly wept in the crowd about his sorrow, his great pain)
between the Palace
Of the Wall and the Caffé where I sat
Beyond the panes I gazed with lucent eyes
Now its good ascend, now its evil descend.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my youth I have navigated
along the dampened sides.
A little island emerged, where rarity
A bird was intent upon its predecessor,
covered with almonds, barefooted, in the sun
fair as emeralds.
When the high tide and the night encircled them,
The sails underventorized more at length,
to hide their insidy.
Today my kingdom is that same land of no one.
The gate enkindles to others its lights,
me to the depths
He still suspends the not-doved spirit,
And of life the dolorous love
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Know'st a moment of the day that's most beautiful at night?
So much more beautiful and less loved?
It is she who precedes no shorter time;
The hour that intense is the work,
And people are seen in the streets moaning;
on the quadrant moles of the houses
a furious moon, one that just
discern in the serene air.
It is the hour you left the plain
To enjoy thy dear city,
from the bright skies to the mountain
varies of expectation in its beauteous unity;
the hour when my life goes full on
Like to a stream unto its sea;
And my thought, the lesser walking
of the crowd, the artisans on the high
a stairway, the child who, running, climbs
on the fractured chariot, everything appears
motionless in action, everything going
it has a semblance of immovableness.
It's the great hour, the hour that accompanies
better than we are used to in our twenty-first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Their songs lay aloft and blasphemy
In the suburban atmosphere. here alone
– I think – it’s the Mediterranean. And my thought
To azure was infused with that name.
Maternal calm imprendibile is Rome.
The Greeks adorn their shores with love
like an adolescence.
obscure the world and renews it in Judea.
Not other to me he smiles beneath the sun.
Ancient sea lost...they will.
The Moses that was born of thee, that I may say
of you, with darkness at the doors, words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With your little bestial eyes
You look at me and wait and then hold me
And look at me and be silent. Thy flesh
Goatful and heavy sleep enraptured
In the early primordial dreams. Prostitute...
Who called you to life? Where do you come from?
From those dark purses of Tirreni, wherein
From the wild singers of Tuscany
O, in the burning sands! Was thy mother underneath the cuffs?
The imminentness drew upon thee the stupor
Within his face a rush of fangs
The burning breath of life
Tragically, just as a Lion disburdens thee of black
And thou beholdest the sacred angel white
That hates and does not love you and suffers
Of you and who weary kisses you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far away birds open in the evening
tremble on the river. And insistent rain
and the glow of illuminated pillows
from the wind. Like any distant thing
return into your mind. The light green
of your garb is here among the trees
burning from the lightning flames where it rises
The sweet Ardenno hill and hears
the gravel on the stems of scullion.
Perhaps in that flight of spirals closed
Along my sorry return lay,
The scorn, the victorious Christian pity,
And this pain stripped of sorrow.
You have a coral flower on your hair.
But thy sight is a shade that does not change;
(this is death). From the darkened houses
Of thy bourgeoisie I hear Adda and the rain,
Or perhaps a fluttering of human steps,
among the keepers of the banks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if joy of me triumph over joy,
is a knot of shadows.
No other hour consoles me
than the silence:
and does not fill our faces with shifting hills and air,
Turns the light its protruding visories
beyond the limit of darkness.
A mobile of light and quiet
In swift deceit doth put us to sleep;
stones that water erodes at every entrance.
Children are still sleeping in your sleep;
Sometimes did I hear a cry out, too,
it breaks and becomes flesh;
and beat a thunder of hands and a voice
Unknown sweetnesses pierced me through.
Back to the roots of it.
