This small island riven underwater by U.S. submarines,
where my great-grandfather planted citrus fruits and vines,
built cowsheds and brought ten cows from the mainland.
Their trembling hoofs on the boat, the wind on their backs
only struck till then by rain from the north.
They’re still there, horns mingled with the sand,
deep-rooted skeletons, close up to the rocks, no longer afraid,
no longer distinguishing pasture from sea.

That evil may decompose like the hamster buried in a shoebox in the garden’s earth.
That the fright destined for others come to me tonight.
I see her, this woman who for hours stared at the tv
on and now screams at another body in twilight
immobile in the colourless armchair.
Accept this silence: the word caught in the dark of the throat like a stiffened animal, like
the stuffed boar that sparkled in the cellar during October storms. Livid and woven with
straw, the dry heart, smokeless, yet against the flash of lightning that nailed the door,
each time in the same exact point where death had begun: the futile backstepping,
body aflame, the hunter’s kick on its side.
Close your eyes. Think: hare and fox and wolf, call the beasts,chased down they race over the flatlands 
and are in the slingshot of dying or falling asleep exhausted inside the den where 
only the hunted know true night, true breath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The word, for me,
came from far away.
An a priori almost
I felt it to be. A stimulant.
By a process in
some way inverse.
In giving it by comparison
a reality that, instead,
the more it was touched and grasped,
the more it fled insubstantial
from the five senses.
With the effect of being
hurled against a body,
pronounced, and then,
in the pronouncing, suddenly
grasped again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many times
have I left
before daybreak or
at dead of night
and often reluctantly
all irritation lost
and my mind on
the threshold of return.
Could they be piled
one on the other
all those roads
and stack those destinations
leaf upon leaf
what a continual drifting
what a monstrous tangle
of distances
would this form
on a map . . .
it would confirm
the sentence that you
will never find rest,
and yet show
how you will never
advance a span,
that the more you go
and the less you stay
you never arrive
nowhere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Round, frozen in its oceans, transparent
like a cell under the microscope
or horizontal with mountains planted firmly above fields
with the tongue of rivers and the stretched out sea.
Every now and then I have an inkling of vertigo:
we’re turning faster. Asleep, I cry out “I’m falling”
and then I feel space, blackness, the stars at the nape of my neck,
fear which vomits forth a thousand spheres.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh that would be hell” you say and doze off.
So I meditate on hell. It’s enough if the curtain’s weight 
tugs the rings along the glass . . . with precision I see:
the marching of a line of ants, the vast starry night.
I try to take hold of hell by its border
(a strip of black, emptiness, fear)
to make it whirl in the courtyard as the fir-tree does in the sky
to become the insect that I’ve always been:
that’s born and forgets itself in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't call, it comes
in a sheen of strength,
already part of your smile
it comes like the smell of the woods,
barely there, the sudden face
of a hare, a fold
in your hands, it sits
upon the throne that you've become.
An extending
beyond the clouds,
it frightens like a rising wind
bending branches, quickening colours.
My love, both beautiful and torn,
its fingerprint is already
our image. And happiness
is waiting, is time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The chequered tablecloth in the white light.
And in the evening.
It would be enough to see
it is evening,
see it at all the tables
of the building
half littered from dinner
or empty with only the remote control
reflected in the blank screen.
It would be enough for the fists clenched without a glass
to open –  
suddenly
they would turn over to beg
beating on the table
and on the flat bone of loneliness.
One would see many men,
many men with their heads bent, thick tongues,
silent before the screen, in the white light, of the evening.
Her goat muzzle, spring would
put it in those hands to graze, confident.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have seen you in a dream
running towards me
surprised and pleased
to have found me again,
and I was as happy
though I felt
that I was
persuaded by the deceit
and that the ecstasy
was especially my own.
And in the crystal
of my vision
through the nose
I have meanwhile
kissed you against a yellow wall
holding your perfume in my arms.
I woke up in a sweat
and throughout the day I was filled with desire and burning inside,
happy to remain roasting in that oven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Park, end of fall, trees
of electric silk and the color of blood
in the cold blue of the sky which rise
open
then slowly turn off
shadow
that is coming, air
that is darkening
And the frozen crown
of the skyscrapers begins to shine
over the darker crowd in the streets.
I ask Oonagh: why do wear your hair like this,
gray at thirty
But dancing she moves the ashes of her head
and her unthinkable sky-blue eyes
draws a magic circle
around Manhattan, makes a fire of herself
and spreads her arms, oars, wings
in the ocean of the evening voices.
You hear her cry out of invisible boats.
In the dark bay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among all the existing species
that imagine possibly a thousand
filaments made up of a thousands of tints
that they propagate from place to place
from a paradise to a continent, a mountain
from millions of generations to acts
of generation, to further symbioses
transitions as far as this oscillating glass
wall where changing from expanse
to expanse they rumble with insectivorous
pomegranate light that names them
in the murmur with which they announce their panic
which like the roar of this water at its end
which soon will not coincide rather like
my belonging to anything, I will have none of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I traversed the whole city.
Then climbed a hill
crowded at first, in the end deserted,
closed off by a little wall,
a corner where alone
I sit; and it seems to me where it ends
the city ends.
Trieste has a sullen
grace, If you like,
it’s a delinquent, bitter, voracious,
with blue eyes and hands too clumsy
to offer flowers;
like love
possessed by jealousy.
From this hill every church,every street, 
I discover, if it follow them to the cluttered shore,
or the stony slope, on whose
summit a house, the last one, clings.
Circling,
surrounding all these things
a strange air, a tormented air,
the native air.
My city, alive in every part,
has left this corner for me, for my life,
pensive, and quiet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At that moment when I was still happy
(God forgive that vast and terrible word) what almost changed my joy to tears? 
You’ll say: ‘Some
lovely creature passing by
who smiled at you’. No, a balloon,
a turquoise balloon, drifting
through the blue sky, with the native
air never so bright in the cold
clear noon of a winter’s day.
The sky with a little white cloud,
and the windows alight in the sun,
and meagre smoke from a chimney or two,
and above those things, divine
things, the sphere that escaped a child’s incautious hand
(surely he wept, in the midst of the crowd, out of grief, his terrible grief) 
between the Stock
Exchange and the Coffee House, where I sat,
beyond the glass, admiring his prize,
clear-eyed, now rising, and now falling.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I was in my younger years I sailed
The coastlines of Dalmatia.
Isles appeared in bloom along the billows where sporadic
Birds hung in intent hunger over prey.
Those algae-slippery isles were glittering
Emeralds in gold sunlight. 
When the high Tide and the night nullified them, 
sails Listed to leeward, farther out to sea,
To flee their perfidy.
Today my kingdom is this grand No Man’s land.
The harbor heights Blaze on for others; 
I to dark broad seas
Am thrust by an indomitable spirit,
By the excruciating love of life.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know a more beautiful time of day than evening? 
More beautiful and less loved? 
That hour which precedes the sacred hours of idleness;
the hour when work is intense, 
and a host of people are seen on the streets;  
over the squared mass of the houses,
a shadowy moon, one you can scarcely
discern in the quiet air.
It’s the time you abandon the countryside
to take joy in your dear city,
from the gulf to the mountains
various aspects in its beauty unite;
the hour when my life in flood flows
like a river towards the sea;
and my thoughts, the swift tread
of the crowd, the workman atop his tall 
ladder, the lad racing to leap
on his rumbling cart, all seem
to freeze in the act, all this motion
acquires the look of immobility.
It is the great hour, the hour that best
attends our time of harvesting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drunken songs and blasphemies rise
from the suburban hostelry. This too
– I know – is the Mediterranean. And my thoughts
are drunk on the azure of that name.
Rome is impregnable maternal calm.
Greece falls in love with its shores
like an adolescent. 
Judea darkens and renews the world. 
No other beneath the sun so smiles on me in my old age.
Ancient lost sea….
Even the Muse, born of you, wishes me to speak
one word of you, with darkness at the door.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With your beady feral eyes
You gaze at me, are silent, wait, and draw near,
gaze again, and are silent. Your flesh
awkward and heavy sleeps torpidly
in primordial dream. Whore…
Who called you to life…and from where?
From some acrid Tyrrhenian port,
from a song-drenched fair in Tuscany?
Or did your mother wallow in burning sands beneath the sirocco?
Immensity engraves wonder
on your savage face of a sphinx
the teeming breath of life
stirs your sombre mane tragically like a lioness’s,
and you gaze at the sacrilegious blond angel
you don’t love, who doesn’t love you, and who suffers
from you, and who kisses you wearily.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distant birds open to the evening
tremble over the river. And the rain insists
and the hiss of poplars illumined
by the wind. Like all things remote
you return to mind. The green light
of your dress is here among the plants
scorched by lightning where the gentle
hill of Ardenno rises and the kite
is heard above the sprays of sorghum.
Perhaps to that tight spiral flight
is entrusted my disillusioned return,
the harshness, the vanquished Christian piety,
and this naked pain of sadness.
You’ve a flower of coral in your hair.
But your face is a shadow that does not change;
(such is death). From the dark houses
of your town I hear the Adda and the rain,
or perhaps a quiver of human footsteps
among the tender reeds of its banks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if through me joy conquers you
it will be a knot of stars.
No other hour consoles us
but that of silence;
and the mutable face of air and hills fails to satisfy,
the light rotates its hollow skies
at the edge of darkness.
Motion and stillness of the stars
hurls night at us in swift deceit:
stones that the water bared at every mouth.
Children are still asleep in your sleep.
I even hear a cry now and then
break off and become flesh;
and a clapping of hands and a voice
opening me to unknown sweeteness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
