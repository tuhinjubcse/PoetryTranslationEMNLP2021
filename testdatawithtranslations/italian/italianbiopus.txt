this little island dug underwater by American submarines,
where my great-grandfather cried vines and citrus
He built stables and brought ten cows from the Continent.
Their trembling cocks on the boat, the wind on their wings
Hit until then only by the northern rains.
They're still there, the sand-mixed horns.
the deep skeletons, stretched to the cliffs
without fear, without distinction between the pastures and the sea.

So that evil may become like the hamster buried in a shoe box in the soil of the garden.
'Cause you're coming to me tonight with other people's scares.
I can see this woman staring at the television for hours.

immobile on the colorless chair.
Accept this silence: the word tightened in the darkness of the throat as an irrigided beast, as the
Cinghiale embalmed that in October struck in the cellar. Livid and intrecciate of
straw, heart dry, no smoke, yet against the lightning that pierced the door, every time
in the exact spot where death had begun: the unnecessary indietreggiare, the burning body, calcium
of the hunter on his side.
Close your eyes. Think: sheep, and fox and wolf call the beasts that you hunt run on the earth.

in pursuit really know the night really the breath.

The word, for me,
He came from afar.
A priori, almost,

In a trial in
Some kind of reverse.
In giving it to you by reference
a reality that, on the other hand,
more touched and taken, more

With the effect of being
launched against a body

It's his turn to say it.
Recalled.

Round, icy of its oceans, clear
like a cell under the microscope
and yet horizontal with mountains laid firmly over the meadows
with the tongues of rivers and sea steeped.
I only sometimes suspect vertigo:
We move faster.
and there I feel space, blackness, stars on the back
the fear of throwing up himself in a thousand balls.

"Oh, that's hell," you say and fall asleep.
Medited on hell then. As long as it moves the weight of the tent
I can see the rings running along the glass.
a strand of ants, their march, the great night of stars.
I try to take hell for a leaf
(a little black, the void and the fear)
to make it wilt in the courtyard so that the beet turns to the sky
to be the bug that I have always been:
born and forgotten in the air.

Don't call him, he's coming
in its semilucent power,
It's already part of your smile.
It's like the scent of the woods,
a nothing, the sudden muso
of the leprechaun, is already a fold
in your hands, sit down
on the throne that it becomes.
It's an increase
which is full of clouds,
It's as scary as the beginning of the wind
that bends the branches but lives the colors.
My beautiful and tormented love,
his print is already in ours

It's the waiting, the weather.

The pictured tablecloth in the white light.
And in the evening.
It's enough to see
It's evening,
see it at all the tables

half a pound from dinner
or undress with the remote control

It's enough with your fists closed without a glass.

batting on the table
and the flat bone of loneliness.
They would see many men,
many men with a low forehead, a big tongue,

His muso of a capre the spring
Would burn in those hands, confident.

I saw you in a dream.
that you came to me
surprised and satisfied
I'm glad you found me.
happy, too
even if you are not hearing
that you knew me
persuaded of the deception
and that the transport
It was mostly mine.
And in the crystal
of my vision
by nose
is, intanto,
that I kissed you against a yellow wall
holding your perfume between your arms.
I woke up in awe
He took my desire and burned me in it all day long,
But I didn't want to turn it off, and I'd just stay in the oven and cook.

Central Park, fall, trees
Of electric silk and coloured blood
in the blue cold of the sky rising

then slowly they turn off,

that's coming, air
that obscures it.
And the crown begins to shine
the ice of the skyscrapers
on the darkest crowd in the streets.
I ask Oonagh, why do you keep your hair like this?
Gray at 30.
But she dancing moves the ash of her head
and the unimaginable celestial eyes

In Manhattan, he burns himself to death
and opens arms, arrows, wings
in the ocean of night voices.
You hear the screams of invisible boats.
In the black bay.

Of all those species that exist
imagined a thousand tracks
filaments of millions of dyes
that carried from one place to another,
from a heaven to a continent, a mountain,
from millions of generations to acts
of generation, to more symbiotic,
transient, oscillating glass
of a wall that is floating from a deck
Distied sounding insecticide
light that tells them,
in the whispering of their panic
so the churning of that water and its ending that soon
they won't match like this anymore.

I've been through the city.
Then I came up an erta,
In the beginning, it was a people's place, in the desert,
locked by a wall:
a spot where only
I sit, and it seems to me that where it ends,
finish the city.
Trieste has a scontrous
If you like it,
He's like a stubborn, wanty boy,
with blue eyes and too big hands
to give a flower;
like a love
Jealous.
From this heritage every church, every way

or to the hill upon which,

a strange, tormented air,
Native air.
My city that is alive in every part,
It's got the spotlight on me, my life

In that moment I was already happy
(God forgive me the terrible word) who almost cried to my short joy?
You'll say, "Check it out."

A balloon instead,
a wandering turquoise balloon
in the blue of the air, and the native
never like in the clear and cold sky
midday snowy winter.
Heaven with some white clouds,
and the windows of the houses on the sun,
and the thin smoke of one two chambers,
and on all things, the divine
things, that globe from the squeaky-clean hand of a lost child
(he certainly cried in the midst of the crowd his pain, his great pain)
between the Palace
of the Exchange and the Café where you sit
beyond the windows I admired with glory

In my youth I have sail
along the Dalmatian coast.
Wave islands emerged, where rare
a bird was so intent on prey,
covered by algae, slippery, in the sun
Beautiful as emeralds.
When the high tide and the night cancelled them out,
wind sails drifted further and farther,
to escape the insidy of it.
Today my kingdom is nobody's land.
The harbor lights its own lamps,
me off the coast
it still troubles the unmoved spirit,
and of life the painful love
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know an hour of the day that's prettier in the evening?
much more beautiful and less loved?
She is the one whose holy oaths he soon precedes.
the hour that intense is the opera,
and you see people floating in the streets;
on the square mole of the houses
a faint moon, a one that barely
discern in the clear air.
It's time you left the country
to enjoy your dear town,
from the bright gulf to the mountains
varies in its beautiful unity;
the time my life goes by
like a river to its sea;
and my thoughts, the lesto walk
of the crowd, the armies at the top,
climbing, the little boy jumping
on the glorious wagon, all appears
stop in the act, all this go
It's got a hint of immobility.
It's the big time, the time that accompanies
better our dying age.

The unforgettable calm Materna is Rome.
We love Greece on its shores

The old man smiles in the sun.
Ancient lost sea...ur wants.
the Musa that was born of you, that I may say

With your little beastly eyes
You look at me and you shut up and wait and then you hold on.
And you look at me and you shut up.
Fat and heavy sleeps twisted
In the primordial dreams.
Where did you come from?
From the acre bring thou tirreni,
From the fairs singers of Tuscany
Or in the dense sands faced your mother under the rocks?
The immensity impressed the stupor
In the face of swan fern
The burning breath of life
Tragically, like a Lionessa, you dismount your black helmet
And you look at the sacred angel biondo
Who does not love and care and suffers
Of you and that tired kissing you.

Far away birds open in the evening
tremano sul fiume. And the rain insistent
and the sibilo of the illuminated poles
From the wind.
I come back to the mind.

Maybe in that spiral flight.
he trusted my disappointed return,
greed, the victorious Christian pity,
and this naked pain of pain.
You have a coral flower on your hair.
But your face is a shadow that does not change;
From the dark houses
I hear the Adda and the rain,
or perhaps a whirl of human steps,
among the keepers of the rivers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if joy wins for you,
It's a shadow knot.
Nothing else now comforts
that the silence:
And the face of the air, and the pieces of it,
turn the light into its wired skies
In the darkness.
Mobile of stars and of quiet
it throws us night into quick deceit:
stones that the water swallows up at each shore.
Children are still sleeping in your sleep;
I can even hear a scream sometimes.
breaking and getting flesh;
and the beat of hands and a voice
Unexplained sweetness.
