this small island pierced underwater by submersible Americans,
where my great-grandson lamented vines and vinegars
he built stables and carried ten cows out of the mainland.
Their trembling jaws on the bark, the wind on their loins
hit until then only by the northern rains.
I am still there, the horns mixed with sand
the deep skeletons, close to the rocks
No more fear, no more distinction between pasture and sea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For evil dissolves like a cricket buried in a shoebox in garden land.
For fear of others comes to me tonight.
I see her, this woman who for hours has stared at the television turned on
and now screams against another body in the shade
motionless on the colorless armchair.
Accept this silence: the word clung in the darkness of the gullet like an irrigated beast, like the
embalsam necklace that in October storms sparkled in the canteen. Livid and encrusted with
straw, the dry heart, smokeless, yet against the lightning that closed the door, every time
at the exact moment when death began: the unwilling indifference, the burning body, calcium
of the hunter on his side.
Close your eyes. Think: it lepers, and fox and wolf it calls the hunted beasts that run on the earth
and are in the wave of dying or alighting thrown into the den where only one is
chased really knows the night really the breath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The word, for me,
Came from afar.
An a priori, quasi,
the affirmative. An exultant.
In a trial in
some other way.
In giving it back
a reality that, on the contrary,
more touched and grasped, more
fled inconsistently
with five senses.
With the effect of being
thrown against a body
pronounced and, in
his telling it, suddenly
retrieved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many times
I have departed
as little as day or
in the heart of the night
and, many controversies
in the finite disdain
with the head
on the threshold of return.
If they could add up
one to the other
all the cracks
and add the condiments
leaf on leaflet
Like to a chain long and adrift,
that most hideous design
of distance
would comprise in its entirety
on the cards..”
would be the reproach
of a condemnation
with no rest at all,
would be seen
that doesn’t advance
of a stretcher,
that goes further
and finds itself less,
that doesn’t happen
nowhere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Round, frozen of its oceans, transparent
like a cell under the microscope
yet horizontally with mountains perched sacred on the meadows
with the tongue of the rivers and the steep sea.
Only at times do I doubt the verdict:
we turn faster. While asleep I cried “hope,”
and there I hear the space, blackness, stars on the nape
The terror that vomits itself into a thousand spheres.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh, that’s Hell,” you say, and you fall asleep.
Meditating on Hell then. Just stir the weight of the tent
making the rings flow along the glass. I see exactly:
A thread of ants, their march, the great starlit night.
I invite you to take Hell for a limb
(a little bit of black, the emptiness, fear)
to make him wend in the courtyard so that the firs may wheel to the sky
to be the insect I’ve always been:
born and forgotten in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t call it, it comes
In its semi-violent force,
is already a part of your smile
it comes like the scent of the woods,
a nothingness, suddenly the snout
of the leprosy, it’s already a fold
in your hands, sits
on the throne you become.
It’s an increase
that has an excess of clouds,
scares me like the start of the wind
that bends the branches but revives the colors.
My love, fair and full of torment,
its imprint is already in ours
figure. Happiness
it's the waiting, it is the time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The boards quadrupled in the white light.
And in the evening.
It would suffice to see
that it is evening,
to see it at all the tables
of the condominium
half worn away from the dinner
or candles with the remote control
reflected in the video turned off.
It would suffice for hands closed without glass
to open up -
of a snatch
would turn to beggars
banging on the table
and on the flat bone of loneliness.
Many men would be seen,
Many men with forehead low, and large tongues,
watch the videos, the white light, in the evening.
Its caper snout the springtime
I would set to burn in those hands, confident.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw you in dreams
that you ran against me
surprised and satisfied
of having found me,
I too am happy
it is only by sensing
that you knew me
persuaded of deception
and that transport
was, above all, my own.
And in the crystal
of my vision
by way of nose
was, meanwhile,
I kissed you against a yellow wall
Holding in thy arms thy fragrance.
Sleepily awake in affray
took my desire and burned me all day,
but I didn’t want to burn it, blessed, staying boiled in the oven.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Park, late autumn, trees
of electric silk and blood color
in the cold blue of the sky rising
open
Then slowly as they go out,
shadow
that’s coming, air
that grows dark.
And the crown begins to shine,
frozen from the skyscrapers
on the narrowest crowds in the streets.
I ask Oonagh: why do you keep your hair like this,
grey at age thirty.
But as she dances she moves the ashes of her head
and the unthinkable celestial eyes
forms a magic circle
In Manhattan, makes of itself a blaze
and opens arms, oars, wings
in the ocean of nocturnal voices.
Feelings shouting of invisible boats.
In the Black Sea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all the species that exist
imagined a thousand tracks
filaments of millions of tints
Which carried from one place to another,
from a paradise to a continent, a mountain,
from millions of generations to acts
of generations, more like each other,
to transitions, to oscillating glass
of a wall that, shifting from discontinuity
slowly rustle insectivorously
the light of an apple tree that speaks to him,
in the crash with which they foreshadow their panic
so does the spurt of that water and its ending that soon
will no longer coincide like this
Not to be a member, I am not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crossed all the city.
Then I climbed an errand,
Populated in beginning, deserted yonder,
shut in by a shutter:
a little cantuccio in which only
I sit; and it seems to me that where this ends,
you terminate the city.
Trieste has a rash
grace. If it please you,
is like a girl who’s rough and voracious,
with blue eyes and hands too big
To give a gift of flower;
like a love
with jealousy.
From this height every church, every path
I discover, if it leads to a shady beach,
or to the hill on which, on the rocky slope,
top, a house, the last, grapples.
Around
circulates to everything
A strange air, a tormented air
the native air.
My city that is everywhere alive,
has made the canticle for me, for my life
thoughtful and impetuous.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that moment when I was already happy
(God forgive me for the great and tremendous word) who almost drove my brief joy to tears?
You will say: “Indeed,
Beautiful creature that was passing on yonder,
And smiled at thee.” A little balloon, meanwhile,
a little turkey wandering in a balloon
in the blue of the air, and the native
Heaven never as in the clear and cold
midday of winter resplendent.
Sky with some white cloud,
And sunlit rooftops of houses,
and the tenuous smoke of one of two chambers,
And on all things, the divine
things, that globe from the captive hand of a child escaped
(He surely cried in the midst of the crowd his grief, his great grieve)
between the Palace
of the Stock Exchange and the Coffeehouse where
Beyond the panes I gazed with lanterns
now ascending and now descending, his good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my youth I navigated
along the battered sides.
Wavelets of flowers were emerging, where rarely
A bird suspended intent on prey,
covered with algae, slippery, in the sun
beautiful as emeralds.
When the high tide and the night annulled him,
Sails downwind fled farther onward,
To escape the siren of it.
Today my kingdom is that nobody's land.
The harbor kindles to others its lights,
me to the shore
still pushes back the spirit that is not tamed,
and of life the sorrowful love
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know an hour of the day that's nicest at night?
so much more beautiful and less beloved?
She is the one who briefly precedes her sacred eyes;
the hour when the work is intense,
and you see people floating in the streets;
on the square moles of houses
a swollen moon, one that barely
you discern in the serene air.
'Tis the hour thou didst leave the plain
To make thee rejoice in thy dear city,
from the luminous gulf to the mountain
varies in its beauteous unity;
the hour when my life goes to the full
Like a river to its own sea;
and my thought, the early walking
of the crowd, the artisans at the top of
stairs, the child who, running, leaps
on the fragrant cart, everything appears
steady in the act, all this going
has a semblance of immobility.
It is the great hour, the hour that accompanies
Better our astonishing age.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brides sing, they rise, and blaspheme
in the suburban undergrowth. here too
– I think – it’s Mediterranean. And my thought
to blue would be inebriated with that name.
Rome is an unforgivable motherly calm.
Greece is enamoured to its borders
like an adolescence.
The world is dark, and Justice renews it.
That’s all the old man smiles at me in the sun.
Ancient lost sea... By will.
The Muse who was born of thee, that I may say
of you, with darkness at the door, words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With your little bestial eyes
You look at me and are silent and you wait and then you grasp
And you look at me and are silent. Your flesh
Lazily and heavily tormented sleep
In primordial dreams. Prostitute....
Who summoned you to life? Where do you come from?
Give to them the acri-ports of Tirren,
From the wild singers of Tuscany
Or in the burning sands licked Was your mother under the spires?
The vastness impresses on thee the wonder
In the ferocious face of spurs
The blazing breath of life
Tragically, as in lion’s fashion your black shield
And thou beholdest the sacred blond angel
That loves not thee nor doth love, and suffers
Of you and who wearily kisses you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far-off birds open in the evening
tremble on the river. And the rain insists
and the whisper of lighted poplars
from the wind. As anything remote
Come back to me. The light green
of your coat is here between the soles
Burning with lightning, where is exalted
The sweet hill of Ardennes, and is despoiled
the sky over the wisteria winds.
Perhaps in that spiral-closed flight
my disillusioned return was delayed,
The scorn, the Christian piety overcome,
and this naked pain of sorrow.
There's a coral flower in your hair.
But your face is a shadow that does not change;
(thus it kills). From the dark houses
Of thy village hear the cord and the rain,
or perhaps a tremor of human steps,
Between the canine teats of the banks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if joy triumphs over me in you,
is a knot of shadows.
Nothing else now consoles
Than silence:
and does not feed us a mute countenance of air and hills,
Light turns about its hollow skies
at the edge of the dark.
Moved by stars and stillness
the night casts us into swift deception:
stones the water drips of at every mouth.
Children still sleep in your sleep;
I sometimes even heard a howl
To break and become flesh;
and clapping hands and a voice
Unknown sweetnesses burst out of me.
--------------------------------
