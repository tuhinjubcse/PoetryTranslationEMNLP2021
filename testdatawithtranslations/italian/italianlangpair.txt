this little isle drilled under water by submersible Americans,
Where my great-grandfather wept vines and cucumbers
He built stables and bore ten oxen from the Continent.
Their trembling hooves on the boat, the wind on their shoulders
hit so far only by the northern rains.
I’m still there, the horns mixed with sand
the deep skeletons, close to the rocks
No more fear, no more discrimination between pastures and the sea
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For evil dissolves like the cricket buried in a shoebox in the garden soil.
For fear of others, it comes to me tonight.
I see her, this woman who for hours has stared at the television set on fire
and now screams against another body in shadow
motionless on the colorless armchair.
Accept this silence: the tight word in the dark of the throat like an irrigated beast, like the
Hippocalypse that in October storms sparkled into a canteen. Livid and embroidered with
straw, heart dry, smokeless, yet against the lightning that enclosed the door, every time
at the exact moment when death had begun: the inutile indifference, the burning body, kicks
of the hunter on his side.
Close your eyes. Think: leprechaun, and wolf, wolverine call the beasts that hunted run upon the earth
and I’m in the wave of dying or of falling asleep fleeing into the den where only one is
pursued really knows the night really the breath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The word, to me,
came from afar.
A priori, as it were,
The affirmative. An exclamation point.
In a process in
somewhat the other way round.
In giving it back
a reality that, on the contrary,
more touched and grasped, more
fled inconsistently
to the five senses.
With the effect of being
thrown against a body
pronounced and, in
its saying, suddenly
re-captured.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many times
I have departed
just day or
in the heart of the night
and, many times, controversy
in the finite aspect
with the head
on the threshold of return.
If they could add up
one to the other
all the holes
and add the meats
leaf upon lea
Like a long chain that branches off,
that monstrous design
of distance
would be composed of the total
on the cards.
would be the retest
of a conviction
without ever resting,
would be seen
that doesn’t advance
of a stretcher,
the farther it goes
and less is found,
that doesn’t happen
nowhere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Round, frozen of its oceans, transparent
like a cell under the microscope
yet horizontally with mountains steadily resting on the meadows
with the tongue of rivers and the rising sea.
Only at times do I fear the vertigo;
we turn more swiftly. As we sleep we cry out
and there I feel space, blackness, stars on the nape
The fright that vomit itself into a thousand spheres.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“That’s hell,” you say, and you fall asleep.
Meditating on hell then. Just let the weight of the tent move
making the rings flow along the glass. I see exactly:
A thread of ants, their march, the great starry night.
I try to take hell for a limb
(a bit of blackness, the void, fright)
to make it roll in the courtyard so the apple trees turn to the sky
to be the insect I’ve always been:
that is born and forgotten in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t call him, he’s coming
in its semi-violent force,
is already a part of your smile
Comes like the scent of the woods,
a nothing, the sudden snout
of the leprosy, it’s already a fold
in your hands, sits
on the throne you become.
It’s an increase
Which has the dimension of a cloud,
it's scary like the beginning of the wind
that bends the branches but revives the colors.
My love fair and full of torment,
his imprint is already in ours
figure. Happiness
is waiting, is time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The squared cloth in the white light.
And in the evening.
It would suffice to see
that it is evening,
to see her at all the tables
of the condominium
half-filled with supper
or sponge with on the remote
reflected in the extinct video.
It would be enough to have your fists closed without a cup
to open up –
of a snapshot
would turn to beg
banging on the table
and on the flattened bone of loneliness.
One would see many men,
a lot of men with short foreheads, big tongues,
mute to videos, to the white light, in the middle of the night.
Their snouts of ferrets the spring
Would put to burning in those hands, confident.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have seen you in dreams
that you ran against me
surprised and satisfied
of having found myself,
happy I too
it’s only by sensing
that you knew me
persuaded by deceit
and that the transport
was especially mine.
And in the crystal
of my vision
by way of nose
has been, meanwhile,
that I kissed you against a yellow wall
Holding in thy arms thy fragrance.
Wake-ups in affliction
took my desire and burned me through the whole day,
but I didn’t want to turn it off blessed, staying in the oven to cook myself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Park, late autumn, trees
of electric silk and blood-coloured
in the cold blue of the sky that rises
they open
and then, as they fade,
shadow
that’s coming, air
that darkened.
And begins to shine the crown
frozen by the skyscrapers
on the nastiest crowds in the streets.
I ask Oonagh: why do you keep your hair like this,
grey at thirty.
But she, dancing, moves the ashes of her head
and the unthinkable celestial eyes
forms a magic circle
in Manhattan, it sets itself on fire
and opens up arms, oars, wings
in the ocean of evening voices.
You hear the shouting of invisible boats.
In the black bay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all those species that exist
imagined a thousand lines drawn
filaments of millions of inks
Which carried us from place to place,
from a paradise to a continent, a mountain,
from millions of generations to acts
of generations, with more symbiosis,
to transitions, to oscillating glass
Of walls, that shifting from stretched out
at length are humming insectivorously
the light that speaks to him is an orange,
in the crash with which they announce their panic
so did the trickling of that water and its end that soon
will no longer coincide like this
not to be a member, I am not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been through the whole city.
Then I climbed an errand,
In principle peopled, deserted there,
enclosed by a little wall:
a little toad in whom only
I sit; and it seems to me that where it ends
ends the city.
Trieste has a scathing
grace. If it pleases,
he’s like an avid, voracious young man,
with blue eyes and hands too big
To give away a flower;
like a love
with jealousy.
From this rocky slope every church, every path
I discover, if it leads to the shady shore,
or to the hill on which, on the rocky slope,
top, a house, the last one, clings.
Round
revolves around everything
A strange air, a stormy air
the native air.
My city that everywhere is alive,
Has made the little tube for me, for my life
thoughtful and harsh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In that moment when I was already happy
(God forgive me for the tremendous and great utterance) Who to the weeping drew my brief joy?
You will say: “Be careful
Beautiful creature that was passing by,
And smiled at you.” Instead, a little one,
a wandering little Turk
in the azure of the air, and the native
Heaven never as in the cold and clear
resplendent midday of winter.
Sky with a few white clouds,
and the windows of houses flaming in the sun,
and the smoke held together by two paths,
And on every thing, the divine
things, that globe by the hand of a runaway child
(He was surely weeping in the midst of the crowd his sorrow, his grief great)
between the Palace
of the Stock Exchange and the Coffeehouse where I sit
Beyond the window panes I gazed with gleaming
now ascending and now descending, his good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my youth I sail
along the divided sides.
Floating islets emerged, where rarely
A bird suspended intent to prey,
covered with seaweed, slipping, in the sun
as fair as emeralds.
When the high tide and the night overshadowed them,
Sails, downwind, farther along the shore,
To escape the insidiousness thereof.
Today my kingdom is that land of no one.
The port enkindles to others its lights,
me to the shore
Suspends yet the unchallenged spirit,
and of life the painful love
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you know an hour of the day that's fairer than the night?
so much more beautiful and less beloved?
She is the one who soon precedes her sacred ears;
the hour when the work is intense,
and people can be seen floating in the streets;
on the square moons of houses
a swollen moon, one that had just
discern in the serene air.
It's time you left the countryside
To enjoy thy city dear to thee,
From the luminous gulf to the mountain
varies in its beautiful unity of waits;
the hour when my life goes in full
Like a river to its own sea;
and my thought, the gentle walking
of the crowd, the artisans at the top
ladder, the child who, as he runs, leaps
on the fragrant car, everything appears
steady in the act, all this going
has the semblance of immobility.
It is the great hour, the hour that accompanies
Better is our ever—changing age.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebony songs they rise up and blaspheme
in the suburban ossteria. here too
– I think – is the Mediterranean. And my thought
To the blue would be inebriated with that name.
Rome is an unfathomable maternal calm.
If Greece unto its borders be enamoured,
like an adolescence.
the world darkens and the Judea renews it.
That’s all the old man smiles at me under the sun.
Ancient lost sea... For he wills.
The Muse that from thee was born, let me say
of you, with darkness at the door, words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With your little bestial eyes
You look at me and be silent and wait and then you tighten
And you look at me and you are silent. Your flesh
Hippo and heavy sleep entangled
In primordial dreams. Prostitute...
Who called you life? Where do you come from?
From the acre bearing the Tirrens,
From the savage singers of Tuscany
Or in the burning sands rolled Was your mother under the rocks?
The immensity brings you the astonishment
Into the ferocious face of rages
The flickering breath of life
Tragically, as at the Lioness your black hair was scattered
And thou beholdest the sacred, blond angel
That he does not love thee nor doth love,
Of thee, and who with thy weariness kiss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far-off birds open in the evening
Tremble on the river. And the rain insists
and the trembling of the lighted poplars
from the wind. Like any thing remote
come back to mind. The light green
of your coat is here between the soles
by the lightning, where it rises
The sweet hill of Ardennes, and is drowned
the nibbus on the sagina winds.
Perhaps in that spiral-enclosed flight
my disappointing return was slowing down,
Harshness, Christian compassion overcome,
and this naked punishment of pain.
You have a coral flower on your hair.
But your face is a shade that does not change;
(that’s how death works). From the dark houses
I listen to the cord and the rain of your village,
or perhaps a trembling of human footsteps,
Among the dog-catching streams of the shores.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if joy overcome thee of me,
is a knot of shadows.
Nothing else now comforts
than silence:
And we are not satisfied with air and hills,
Let the light turn its heavens like a beam
at the limit of darkness.
Moving of stars and of stillness
Night casts us into swift deceit:
stones that water drips at every mouth.
Children are still asleep in your sleep;
I even sometimes heard a howl
to shatter and turn into flesh;
and beat with hands and a voice
Sweetnesses unknown to me unravel.
----------------------------------------------------------
