It is always somewhere, but whoever discovers it by chance
in a nameless street, usually stumps on a
closed door behind which silence reigns
Or seems to reign. Most go on
back to the familiar street plan
and forget their existence.
Is the museum liquid, foldable
consists of prisms, electric fields
or does it sometimes coincide with who’s thinking of you?
Mostly it’s abandoned, the walls
and display cabinets empty after the years
who questioned each other about their righteousness
Whether it fills itself with mist, with
a hesitant voice that asserts itself
nothing more to remember, practically nothing.
But one face, one sound and one lightfall
can suddenly provide access to the
exhibition where everything proves to be preserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the third bench I’m floating,
pale water-stumpy and not tired.
There’s a swell, high and slow,
on which a few birds rise and disappear.
I’m looking up from a tide’s head.
There’s no beach. The coast is dark
with here and there a light. I descend.
The shoulder lift of my sea lasts long,
indifference is slow
like summer. Ask, the silence, ask again.
I’m not in the mood for that conversation,
go underneath it and feel the pull,
cover, board, lamp in a foaming valley,
of being, before being taken.
From far away from my clothes to land.
I put them on. Whinnifering from too much universe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evening approaches; I lay myself down.
In the decaying wine solace is sought
and much has been found. Fearlessly
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep undisturbed.
Untouched by sin is my part.
The windows, soft holes;
the fall, which is virtually equal to the jump; and the thirst,
the illegible one, that cheats us and comforts us, stays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With ever more playful ease
I dismantle the attacks
on my heavily stressed indifference.
The skies are dripping, with splendour and all,
the trees languidly let their sparkling decay hang.
No eye, no ear. A broad smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my last weaknesses.
I will wallow until repetition becomes uncomfortable,
and once again spoil the filth from my hard hands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was late in the evening
trapped in lamp light
lay down on the cobbles
of the English Channel
you were in an off-white dress
I reckoned you at fifteen
you walked down the street
that I too was talking about
cars passed by braking off
drove on again
you asked the way to De Muze
the café where Ferre optrad
Grignard the singer of your song
voice you’d found
to which you were now on your way
“Just follow the tram rails”
and I let you go
Antwerp girl
that I carry in my heart
what have I done anyway
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I would write you a letter
a letter in which I wanted to understand something
but I didn’t, it went too slowly
I wrote and I looked at my hand
how that hand slowly recognising words
in that manuscript something like
a house – I wanted to know in which we lived
to understand that I would write a letter
but I saw only the prudent words
that I knew before I understood them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamt of the evening in the cities
in Paris I walked a long time on boulevards
searched for francs on the tarmac
the bistros waved
with black coffee and hard-cooked eggs
I could get on basketball shoes
waiting for morning
writing listening and drinking
the first weeds rose the earliest labourers
on early bikes the first metro
with yellow human faces and still moist neck hair
the first newspaper and the world’s first light
I dreamt I could speak in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you’ve spent something, you want it back,
a book or are it bamboo towels, you
she doesn’t get and you think: I’m leaving it like that.
A distance visor or is it a portable
radio. What matters. There is a balance
between the borrowed and the
no longer have in the house. The plumber moves in
to Buenos Aires, takes the radio,
listens to local stations, or
otherwise he’ll look through the glass
to the mountains that now seem accessible
and suppose you do want the book back
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the humming of the telephone your voice sounded
even softer than you like to be,
inflicts harm, pretends to be.
Ah, for months, you said, that blind doubt
to call you. You were just as much there as I
happened to happen that night.
Silence. I judge the angry passivity
that helps you find my body again
and drags it to and fro.
If need be, you said, I’ll call you tomorrow.
You screen something with an emptiness that
simply lets you undo it.
Lay me down beside you. Sometimes I dream
still children of you, playfully.
Nice, smiling faces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whose words drive our veins back and forth
and the whispers of every word
where you used to be,
who steeped them against my brow;
between the words
hair nothing to tell you,
my lord unrelentingly
the afternoon rest.
On Saturdays the servants of the
close for the war.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think of God
in a discounted, light-blue summer dress
other dresses bear other words:
inconceit, timidity, cowardice
two brothers run into each other,
kill each other,
they didn’t ask for that
and not at all for me
that has instigated them at random
I sleep tightened to the utmost,
every fiber of me sleeps
and misunderstanding passes,
a word I don’t know,
that is bare, has fused with the enemy
they’re vilified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond the waterfall, going over rustling fields,
hurled above the bottle’s moss, jumping from cliffs
in spring tide; you used to see them everywhere,
in each poem picturesque passersby who wandered,
conversed, screamed if need be. Brighter days
walked through the underworld when poetry
hung rose-coloured on the branches, free
like an unveiling that now was about to become real
in the reciprocity of words –
still always await disgrace and dismay
keeping our mouths shut behind the trees.
