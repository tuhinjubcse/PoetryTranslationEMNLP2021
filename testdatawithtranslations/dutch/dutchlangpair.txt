It is always somewhere, but those who discover it by chance
in a nameless street, usually stumps on a
shut door behind which silence reigns
Or seems to rule. Most people go through
back to the trusted street map
and forgotten their existence.
The museum is liquid, foldable
it consists of prisms, electric fields
or does it sometimes coincide with those who think it?
Mostly it is abandoned, the walls
and display cabinets empty for years after
who questioned each other on their righteousness
Or filling itself up with mist, with it
a hesitating voice that claims itself
nothing more to remember, practically nothing.
But one face, one sound and one light fall
can suddenly grant access to the
exhibition where everything proves to be preserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the third bench I keep my head spinning,
bluish water dripping and not tired.
There’s a swell going on, high and low,
on which some birds rise and disappear.
I can see from a wave’s crest above.
There is no beach. Dusk rolls along
with a light here and there. I descend.
The shoulder lift of my sea lasts long,
indifference is slow
as summer. Ask, the silence, ask again.
I’m not in for the talk,
go through it all and feel the pull,
recluse, board, lamp in foaming valley,
of something, taken for something.
Came to the land far from my clothes.
I pull them on. Laughing from too much universe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evening approaches; I lay myself down.
In the tarnishing wine consolation is sought
and much was found. Like a fear
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep clumsily.
Chance baptism is my part.
The windows, soft gaps;
the fall, which is almost equal to the jump; and the thirst,
the unreadable, that cheats us on and soothes us, it stays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With ever more playful ease
I cut off the attacks
on my hard-fought indifference.
The skies are dripping with splendour and all,
the trees languidly hang their sparkling leaves.
No eye, no ear. A broad smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my final weaknesses.
I shall veil myself until repetition is unwelcome,
and wash the dirt away from my hard hands once more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was late in the evening
trapped in lamplight
lay down on the scaffolds
of the Mechelse Steenweg
you were wearing an off-white dress
I estimated you at thirty-five
you walked down the street
that I too turned to
cars passed by braking off
drove on again
you asked the way to The Museum
the café where Ferre ate his fill
The singer of your song grins
voice you had found
you were on your way to now
“Follow the tram rails”
and I let you go
Antwerp's girl
that I carry in my heart
what have I done
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I would write you a letter
a letter in which I wanted to understand something
but I didn’t, it went too slowly
I wrote and I looked at my hand
how that hand, slowly counting words,
something like
a house – I wanted to know where we lived
to understand that I would write a letter
but all I saw were the cautious words
I drew before I could grasp them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamed in the evening cities
in Paris I walked a long way over boulevards
looking for francs on the tarmac
the bistros nodded
with black coffee and hard-cooked eggs
I could get on basketball shoes
to await the morning
writing, listening and drinking
the first sweeps of roses the early labourers
on early bikes the first metro
with yellow human faces and still moist neck hair
the first paper and first light
I dreamt I could speak in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e lent something out, want it back,
a book or are they bamboo towels, you
she won’t get it and you think: I’m leaving it at that.
A distant observer or is it a portable
radio. What does it matter. There is a balance
between the lent and the receivable
no longer in the house. The owner moves out
to Buenos Aires, takes the radio,
listens to local stations, or
otherwise he’d peer through the glass
to the mountains that now seem accessible
and supposing you wanted the book
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The trembling of the telephone gave your voice a ring
softer than you like to be,
pretending to be.
Ah, for months, you said, that blind doubt
to call you. You were just as much there as I
completely coincidentally close to that night.
Silence. I value the furious staying put
with which you’ll find my body again
and drag it there, pull it in.
If need be, you said, I’ll call you tomorrow.
You screen things with a void that stretches
simply lets them be dislocated.
Lay me down beside you. Sometimes I dream
still children of yours, playfully.
Beautiful, tanned faces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whose hair our veins protects words
and whispers of every word
where you were before,
who will bet bet on mequor;
between the words
they have nothing to tell you,
lord it over you unbidden
the day’s rest.
Saturdays the guards went from
closed for war.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think of God
in a priced, light-blue summer dress
other words wear other dresses:
inconceivability, shyness, wilfulness
two brothers meet each other,
kill each other,
they didn’t ask for it
and not for me at all
who by chance invented them
I sleep tense to the utmost,
every veil of me sleeps
and confusion passes,
a word I don’t know,
that is bare, has fought with the enemy
accusations are levelled.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond the waterfall, going over rustling fields,
snorted above the bottle moss, jumping from cliffs
at spring tide; you used to see them everywhere,
in each poem picturesque passersby who woke up,
conversations, screams if need be. Brighter days
walked through the underworld when poetry
hung from the branches rosy-coloured, free
like an unveiling that was now to become real
in the reciprocity of words –
still await misdemeanour and doubt
keeping our mouths shut behind the trees.
