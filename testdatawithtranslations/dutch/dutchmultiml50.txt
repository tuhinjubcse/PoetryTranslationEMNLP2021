It's always somewhere, but whoever discovers it by chance
in a nameless street, usually ends up on a pedestrian street.
It's a closed door, and there is silence.

Is the museum liquid, foldable?
It's made up of prisms, electric fields.
or does it sometimes coincide with who's thinking about it?
Usually it's left, the walls.

Or it fills up with fog, with it.
It's a deafening voice that claims to be
nothing to remember, virtually nothing.
But one face, one sound, a flash of light.

an exhibition where everything turns out to be preserved.

By the third bench, I'm floating.
and not tired.
There's a stream running, high and low,
on which some birds rise and disappear.
Again, I'm looking up from a wavetop.
There is no beach. There's no shore.
with a light here and there. I fell.
The shoulder lift of my sea takes a long time,
the invariance is slow.
as summer. Ask, silence, ask again.
I'm not going to get into that conversation.

deck, plank, lamp in a sliding valley,
of something, taken for something.
I've come far from my clothes to land.
I wear them. Narrator: From too many universes.

The evening is coming; I'm laying down.
Searching for solace in the deafening wine
and found a lot of them. It's terrifying.
when I go down to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep uncomfortably.
Initial possession is my part.
The windows, the soft holes;
the fall, which is almost the same as the jump; and the hunger,
the unreadable, which grabs us and reassures us, it stays.

Increasingly easy to play.
I'm going to shut down the attacks.
on my hard-fought invincibility.
The skies are falling, with all their splendor,
the trees hanging in their roaring shame.
No eye, no ear. A big smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my last weaknesses.
I'm going to shy away from repetition until it's unwanted.
and wipe the dirt off my hard hands again.

It was late at night.

you were wearing an offwhite dress.
I estimated you at fifteen.
you were walking down the street
that I've been talking about.
cars were turning off their brakes.
The reason goes further.
you asked the way to the Muze
the cafe that Ferre went to.
Grignard: The singer of your song
the voice that you had found.
where you were going now.
"Follow the trams."
and I let you go.

Today, I'd like to write you a letter.
a letter in which I wanted to understand something.
But I didn't. It was too slow.
I wrote, and I looked at my hand.
how that hand slowly drew words.
in that manuscript, something like
a house -- I wanted to know where we lived.
In order to understand that, I would write a letter.
But all I saw were the words of promise.
that I drew before I understood them.

I was dreaming in the cities at night.
In Paris, I spent a lot of time walking on boulevards.
looking for francs on the tarmac.
the bistros were waving.
with black coffee and hard boiled eggs.
I could wear basketball shoes.
waiting for tomorrow.
writing, listening and drinking.
The first wrestlers, the first workers.
on early bikes, the first subway.
with yellow human faces and still wet neck hair.
The first newspaper and the first light.
I dreamed I could speak in Paris.

a book, or are they bamboo towels, you know?

between the lending and the borrowing.
The lender moves out of the house.

When the phone rang, your voice sounded
even softer than you like.
pretending to be.
Oh, for months, you said, that blind doubt
to call you. You were there as much as I was.
by chance that night.
Silence. I admire the outrageous ignorance
with which you can find my body.
and it carries it there, pulls it up.
If I have to, you said, I'll call you tomorrow.
You're dealing with a void that's expanding.
it's easy to dismantle.
Put me down next to you. Sometimes I dream
children of yours, playfully.
Beautiful, entrancing faces.

Who harvests our own words of remembrance?
and visions of every word.
where you were afraid,
who's going to put them up against me?

Only the unforgiving lord reigns.

Once upon a time, the servants of

two brothers meet,
killing each other.
They didn't ask for it.
and it's not about me at all.
who tricked them into doing it.
I sleep in utmost tension,
every fiber of me sleeps.

a word I don't know.
that's bald, has memories of the enemy.
it's being maligned.

Behind the waterfall, over rustling fields,
hovering over bottlenecks, jumping off cliffs.
you used to see them all over the place.
in every poem, picturesque passers-by who roared,
and screaming at the end of the day. Brighter days
walked through the underground when poetry
hanging gray on the branches, free
as a revelation that was about to become a reality.
in the reciprocity of words --
still await shame and contempt.
behind the trees.
