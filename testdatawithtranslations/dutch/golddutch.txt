It's always somewhere, but whoever happens upon it
in some nameless street, usually runs into
a closed door behind which silence reigns
Or seems to reign. Most go on
back to the familiar layout of streets
and forget its existence.
Is the museum fluid, can it be folded
does it consist of prisms, electric fields
or just coincide with whoever thinks of it?
It's mostly deserted, the walls
and display cases empty save for dates
each debating whether the other is accurate
Or it fills with fog, with a
hesitant voice inside claiming
to remember nothing, virtually nothing.
But one single face, sound, incidence of light
can suddenly afford entrance to the
exposition where all has proven preserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Past the third bank I start to float,
not tired, faintly treading water.
There is a swell, tall and lethargic,
on which some birds rise up and disappear.
On top again, I look behind me from a crest.
There is no beach. A glimmering of coast,
with here and there a light. And I go down.
The shoulder-shrugging of my sea lasts long,
with slow indifference, like the summer.
A question, silence, then a counter-question.
I do not figure in this conversation,
I go down under, feel the pull,
lid, plank, lamp, in a foaming valley,
once part of something, taken for something.
Far from my clothes I come ashore. I dress -
still shivering: too much cosmos.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evening draws near; I lay myself out.
Solace is sought in preservative wine
and much is found. The same as dregs
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep restlessly.
Unwanted sediment is mine.
The windows, tender holes;
the fall, well-nigh the same as jumping; and so thirst,
the insatiable, which taunts and comforts us, remains.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With ever greater playful ease
I counter the attacks
on my hard-won indifference.
The heavens fall back, glory and all,
trees let dangle in dejection their sparkling leaves.
No eye, no ear. A broad smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my final weaknesses.
I’ll satiate myself till repetition is no longer wanted,
and wash the dirt from my hard hands once more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was late in the evening
rain caught in lamplight
beat down on the cobbles
of the Old Mechlin Road
you were wearing an off-white dress
I’d have guessed you were fifteen
you were walking down the street
as I was crossing
cars passed by
braked rode on
you asked me the way to the Muse Café
the bar where that singer was on
singer you said of your song
voice that had found you
you were on your way there
“Just follow the tramlines”
I let you go
Antwerp girl
you’re still on my mind
what have I done
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I was to write you a letter
a letter in which I wanted to understand something
but I didn’t write it, it went too slowly
I wrote and I looked at my hand
how that hand was slowly drawing words
in that handwriting something like a house began
to grow – I wanted to know what it was we’d lived in
to understand that, I was to write a letter
but all I saw were the clumsy words
that I was drawing before I understood them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamed in the cities at night
in Paris I prowled on the boulevards
looking for francs on the tarmac
the bistros lured
with their black coffee and hard-boiled eggs
I could wait there until morning
in my basketball shoes
writing listening and drinking
the first rosy streaks of sky the first workers
on early bikes the first metro
with yellow human faces and nape hair still wet
the first newspaper at first light
in Paris I dreamed I could speak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You lent out things, you want them back,
a book or Nim matchsticks perhaps, you
won’t get them and think: I’ll let it go.
Binoculars or is it a portable
radio. What does it matter, balance
has been struck between the lent and
what the house now lacks. The lender
moves to Buenos Aires, takes the radio
and listens to the local stations, or
he might use the binoculars to look at
mountains now appearing within reach.
Suppose the book had been returned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The muffling telephone made your voice
even softer than you like to be,
copy, aspire to be.
Oh, for months, you said, those blind doubts
about ringing you. Neither you nor I
was there wholly by chance that night.
Silence. I assess the furious doggedness
with which you rediscover my body
and carry it, drag it there.
If need be, you said, I’ll call again tomorrow.
You waffle a bit about an emptiness that’s
easily sent awry.
Lay me next to you. Sometimes I still
dream of children of yours, as in a game.
Beautiful faces that cry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had our own supply of words
and knew what each and
every word was for,
we placed them close to each other;
between the words
you had nothing to say,
there unrelentingly
Sunday rest reigned.
In the evening the curtains from
before the war were drawn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think of God
in a marked-down, pale-blue summer dress
other words are wearing other dresses:
disregard, bashfulness, spite
two brothers run into each other,
beat each other to death,
they haven’t asked for this
and most certainly not for me
who randomly invented them
I sleep, tense in the extreme,
every fibre of me is asleep
and dis-understanding comes past,
a word I don’t know,
a word that’s bald, and in league with the enemy,
there’s evil talk about.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind the waterfall, roaming across rustling fields,
crouched above liverwort, springing from cliffs
at springtide; you used to see them everywhere,
in every poem picturesque passers-by with their orations,
conversations, screams if need be. Lighter the days
in this sublunary world when poetry
hung roseate upon the branches, free
as a burgeoning. Now that would grow real
in a reciprocity of words  –
yet stolidly as ever, ignominy and despair
lie in wait for us behind the trees.`
