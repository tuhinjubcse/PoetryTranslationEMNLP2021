It's always somewhere, but whoever finds it by chance
in a nameless street, usually stumbled on a
Closed door with silence behind it
Or seems to prevail.
back to the familiar street plan
and forgot his existence.
Is the museum liquid, foldable
consists of prisms, electric fields
Or does it sometimes coincide with whoever's thinking about it?
Usually it's abandoned, the walls
and display cases empty after years
who denied each other their righteousness
Or it fills with mist, with in it
a hesitant voice that pretends to be
Nothing to remember, almost nothing.
But one face, one sound, a flash of light
can suddenly provide access to the
exhibition where everything turns out to be preserved.

By the third bench, I'm floating,
Fluffy, dripping and not tired.
There's a slope, high and low,
on which some birds rise and disappear.
Upstairs, I'm looking out of a golf course.
There's no beach.
With a light here and there.
The upliftment of my sea takes a long time,
the invariance is slow
Ask, the silence, ask again.
I'm not in that conversation.
go under it and feel the thrill,
deck, plank, lamp in sliding valley,
Been from something, taken for something.
Came to the country far from my clothes.
I'm pulling them up, shivering from too much of the universe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The night is coming; I'm going to lie down.
In the deafening wine is sought solace
and found a lot.
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep restlessly.
Unwanted debauchery is my part.
The windows, soft holes;
the fall, which is almost equal to the leap; and the thirsty,
The unreadable, which deceives and reassures us, it remains.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easier and easier to play
I'll stop the attacks.
on my hard-fought inflexibility.
The heavens are falling down with splendor,
Let the trees hang heedless of their blazing rage.
No eye, no ear, a wide smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my last weaknesses.
I'll be content until repetition is desired,
And wash the dirt off my hard hands one more time.

It was late in the evening
rain caught in lamplight
dropped on the coffers
of the Mechelse Steenweg
You were wearing an offwhite dress.
I estimated you at fifteen.
You were walking down the street
Whatever I was talking about
cars passed brakes off
go on again
You asked the way to the Muse
the cafe where Ferre ate
Grignard the singer of your song
voice you had found
Where you were on your way now
“Follow the tram tracks”
And I let you go
Antwerp girl
That I carry in my heart
What have I done?
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I would write you a letter
a letter in which I wanted to understand something
But I didn't. It was too slow.
I was writing and I looked at my hand
how that hand slowly drew words
In that handwriting, something like
a house – I wanted to know where we lived
To understand that I would write a letter
But I saw only the gentle words
I drew them before I understood them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamed in the cities at night
In Paris I walked long boulevards
looking for francs on the asphalt
the bistro's wenkten
with black coffee and hard boiled eggs
I could be on basketball shoes.
Waiting for the morning
Reading, listening and drinking
The first sweep rose the first workers
on early bikes the first metro
with yellow human faces and still moist neck hair
The first newspaper and the first light
I dreamed I could speak in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You borrowed something, you want it back,
a book or are the bamboo sticks, you
You don't get it, and you think, "I'm gonna leave it like this."
A binoculars or is it a portable
There's a balance.
between the lending and the borrowing
The landlord is moving out.
to Buenos Aires, take the radio,
listens to local stations, or
Otherwise he'll look through the glass
to the mountains that now seem accessible
And suppose you return the book
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the ringing of the phone your voice sounded
even lower than you'd like to be,
fakes, pretends to be.
Oh, for months, you said, that blind doubt
You weren't there like I was.
That night totally by accident.
I appreciate the outrageous obedience.
with which you will find my body back
And it's carrying it there, dragging it along.
If I have to, you said, I'll call you tomorrow.
You're covering something with a void that's
It's easy to dismantle.
Put me down next to you.
still children of yours, playfully.
Beautiful, entrancing faces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Who harden our aged hearts"
and whispers of every word
where t was afraid,
Who sets them up against Mecca?
between the words
don't tell you anything,
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.
The afternoon nap.
Soon afterwards, the servants of
Close the war.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think of God
in a cheap, light blue summer dress
Other words wearing other dresses:
recklessness, cunning, bravery
Two brothers meet,
beat each other to death,
they have not asked for
And not for me at all.
Who has contrived them in their stealth.
I sleep to the utmost tense,
Every fiber of me sleeps
and despair passes,
a word I don't know,
that is bald, has mourned with the enemy
There's evil talk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind the waterfall, over rushing fields,
Hooked on top of bottle moss, bouncing off cliffs
You used to see them everywhere,
In every poem picturesque passers-by who listened,
Conversing, shouting if necessary.
# Wandered through the underworld # # When there was poetry #
Rosy-coloured, hanging from the branches, free
as a vent that was about to become a real vent
in the reciprocal sense of the word,
Still waiting shame and doubt
Behind the trees.
