It is always somewhere, but who discovers it by chance
in a nameless street, mostly stuns at a
curtain-shaped door beyond which silence reigns
Or seems to heerser. Most people walk on
back to the familiar street map
and forgotten its being.
Is the museum water-proof, folded-in
it consists of prisms, electrified fields
or does it sometimes coincide with those who are thinking of it?
Sometimes it is abandoning, the walls
and storage cupboards empty on all counts
who unite in their rightness
Or it fills itself with fog, with in
a hesitant voice claiming to
nothing more to remember, almost nothing.
But one face, one sound, a light fall
can suddenly give access to the
exhibition where everything turns out to be preserved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the third floor I hold myself floating,
fleeting from the water and not tired.
There’s a swell, high and sloom,
on which some birds rise and disappear.
Outer above, out of a golf course, I gaze.
There’s no beach to be found. The stars
with here and there a light. I rise.
The shoulder-pull of my sea is long,
the indifference is slow
as summer. Ask, silence, re-suspect.
I don’t get into that discussion,
go under and feel the pull,
cover, plank, lamp in sliden valley,
of something, taken for something.
Been set out far from my clothes.
I pull them on. Narrelled by too much universe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evening nears; I give up.
In the upstream wine consolation is sought
and many have been found. Almost
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep narrowly.
Vulnerable disaster is my part.
The windows, soft gaps;
the fall, which nearly equals the jump; and the thirst,
the unbearable, which cheers us up and comforts us, that stays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With increasing ease
I’ll drop the attacks
on my defieded indifference.
The skies drip off, glittering and full,
the trees give up unnecessarily their glowing leaf.
No eye, no ear. A broad smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my last weaknesses.
I shall conceal myself until repetition becomes unnecessary,
and wash the dirt again from my hard hands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was late in the evening
captured rain in lamplight
lay down on the shelves
of the Mechelse Steenweg
you wore an offwhite dress
I estimated you at five
you walked down the street
that I too went over
cars passed braking off
and set off again
you asked where to go to Museum
the café where Ferre rode
Grignard the singer of your song
voice you’d found
where you were now on your way
“Just follow the tram tracks”
and I let you go
Antwerp’s girl
that I carry in my heart
what have I done
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I’d write you a letter
a letter I wanted to understand something
but I didn’t do that, it went too slowly
I wrote and I looked at my hand
how that hand slowly recognized words
in that handwriting something like
a house – I wanted to find out where we lived
to understand that I would write a letter
but I only saw the confident words
I recognised before I understood them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamt in the cities at night
in Paris I walked long across the boulevards
looked for francs on the asphalt
the bistro’s beckoned
with black coffee and parsley eggs
I could throw it on my basketball shoes
to wait for the morning
writing, listening, drinking
the first feather rose the early labourers
on early cycles the first tram
with yellow people’s faces and still moist neck hair
the first paper and light
I dreamt I could speak in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e’ve worn something out, you want it back,
a book or are the bamzaaistocks, you
she doesn’t get you and you think: I’m just leaving.
A far-off glance or is it a carryable
radio. What gives it. There is a balance
born between the disposed and the
no longer in the house. The lener moves
to Buenos Aires, takes the radio,
listens to local stations, or
otherwise he looks through the far-sighted
to the mountains now concealed
and if you can still get the book back
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your voice was sounded by the telephone
softer than you ever like to be,
pretends to be.
For months, you said, that blind doubt
to call you. You were nothing but
coincidently that night.
Silence. I count the treacherous rage
with which you will find my body
and carrying it there, to pieces.
If need be, you said, I’ll call you tomorrow again.
You struggle with an emptiness that
simply lets go.
Lie down beside you. Sometimes I dream
are still children of yours, playfully.
Nice, betraying faces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We caress our ails ahead of words
and visions of every word
how it had gone,
who do they set against a moth;
between the words
your hair has nothing to offer,
there was no mercy
the afternoon rest.
Repeatedly the grasshoppers
before the war closes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think of God
in a deprived, light-blue summer dress
other words wear other dresses:
inconsideration, fear, determination
two brothers come to one end,
beat each other to death,
they did not ask permission
and not because it’s convenient
who stole them from him
I sleep to the very bitter end,
every flower of me sleeps
and confusion passes by,
a word I don’t know,
that’s bare, has fought with the enemy
there is harassment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond the waterfall, over rustling fields,
hovering over bottles of milk, jumping from crests
by spring tide; you’d see them everywhere,
in every poem pitoresks passers-by who roared,
converseed, if need be screamed. Brighter days
went through the submerged when poetry
hung rose-coloured on the branches, free
like a revelation that had now become real
in irreparability of words –
still waiting for shame and doubt
silently behind the trees.
