It's always there, but whoever discovers it by chance...
in a nameless street, usually stumble upon a
Thick door behind which there is silence
Or seems to rule.
back to the trusted street plan
and forgotten his existence.
Is the museum liquid, unwrought
It consists of prisms, electrified fields
Or is it associated with whoever thinks about it?
Usually it's abandoned, the walls.
and storage closets empty by the years
who dispute each other's truths
Or it fills with fog, with in it
A hesitant voice pretending to be
Nothing to remember, virtually nothing.
Only one face, one sound, only one lightfall
may suddenly grant access to the
exhibition where everything seems to be preserved.

By the third bank, I'm floating,
fainting and not tired.
There's a breeze, high and steady.
A few birds rise and disappear.
Upstairs, I look like I'm on a golf course.
There is no beach.
With a light here and there.
The scaffolding of my sea will take long,
The indifference is slow
As summer, ask, silence, rejoinder.
I'm not gonna be in that conversation.
Get under it and feel the pull,
cover, plank, lamp in shining valley,
Of something, taken for something.
Came a long way from my clothes.
I'm pulling them on because there's too many galaxies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The night is approaching, and I'm going to lie down.
The wines that are preserved need nourishment.
And found a lot.
I descend to the bottom of the glass,
where I sleep uncomfortably.
Unwanted poison is my share.
The windows, soft holes;
the fall, which is nearly the jump; and the thirst,
The unlearned, who tarts and reassures us, he stays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With ever more convenient convenience
I'll drop the attacks
On my heavy-armed indifference.
The heavens are falling down with beauty and glory.
The trees will hang courageously on their shining leaves.
No eye, no ear, a broad smile.
You bring wine and yourself: my last weaknesses.
I'll saddle myself until recurrence is unwanted.
And rinse the dirt off with my hard hands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was late in the evening
rain caught in lamp light
knocked down on the kasseien
of the Mechelsean Road
You were wearing an offwhite dress.
I thought you were fifteen.
You were walking down the street
Whatever I was about
cars passing brakes off
Carriage back
You asked the way to The Muse
The cafe where Ferre ate
Grignard the singer of your song
voice you'd found
Where you're headed now
“Just follow the tram lines.”
And I let you go
Antwerp girl
that I carry in my heart
What have I done?
with my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today I'd write you a letter
A letter in which I tried to understand something
But I didn't, it was too slow.
I wrote and I looked at my hand
How that hand drew words slowly
There was something like this in that handwriting.
a house – I wanted to know where we lived
To understand that I would write a letter
But I only saw the cautionary words
I drew them before I understood them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dreamed in the cities at night
In Paris I walked long boulevards
Looking for francs on the asphalt
the bistro wenkten
With black coffee and cooked eggs
I could put it on basketball shoes
Waiting for the morning
writing listening and drinking
The first feathers rose the first workers
On early bicycles the first metro
with yellow human faces and moist neck hair
The first newspaper and the first light
I dreamed I could speak in Paris
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You borrowed something, you want it back,
a book or are it bamboo seeds, you
You don't get it and you think, "I'll leave it like this."
A verreiker or is it a portable
Whatever.
between the borrowed and the
The borrower moves
to Buenos Aires, take the radio,
listens to local stations, or
Otherwise, he'll look through the glass.
To the mountains that now seem accessible
And let's say you get the book back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the phone dipped, your voice was ringing.
softer than you like to be,
pretending to be.
For months, you said, that blind doubt.
You were no more there than I was.
that night just by chance.
Silence.
With which you will find my body
and carry it there, drag it.
If I have to, you said, I'll call you tomorrow.
You're covering up an emptiness that's
easily disintegrate.
Put me down next to you.
You still have children of yours to play with.
Beautiful, betraying faces.

Who haren our aigen veurroad words

Who are they turning against mekoar?

There was no law against it.

Soon the servants of
Close the war.

I think of God
in a priced, light blue summer dress
Other words wear other dresses:
innocence, scheming, bravery
two brothers meet,
beat each other to death,
They didn't ask for it.
And not for me at all.
who has made up for them
I sleep to the bone,
Every fiber of me sleeps
And misbelief passes,
a word I don't know,
that is bald, has been with the enemy
There's a lot of harassment.

Behind the waterfall, passing through murky fields,
Chopped over bottled moon, jumping from cliffs
You used to see them everywhere,
In every poem, picturesque passersby who obeyed,
conversed, if need be, screamed.
passing through the sub-continental when poetry
rose-coloured on the branches, free
as an eclipse that was about to become real
in the reciprocity of words –
still awaiting shame and doubt
Standing behind the trees.
