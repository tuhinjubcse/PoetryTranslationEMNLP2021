take me with you to your places
where pleasure and ecstasy were never invented
tie my heart up with a rubber hose
tie my heart up and let it swell
we cross fields voided of light
a barren scenery in which I cannot
hide anymore
blindfolded
I retrace your steps over the day
your painful fragility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my life is an endless field of snow.
in front of the window, I tell you that snow wipes away everything,
every trace.
I broke the mirror that reflected me whole,
I can’t stand myself.
don’t ask me why my left hand hits objects,
I can’t stand myself.
my life is an endless field of snow.
making love like you’re shut inside an iron maiden.
laughing to the point of exhaustion.
replace a severed head with another
and your arms encircle me violently and place me among objects.
the sun like an incision on the winter sky.
forcing the limits of control, knowing the exact dosage,
all you need to do is not fall asleep.
I am an endless field of dirty snow.
I wipe away everything.
every trace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the day out of which I don’t want to rise
like out of an icy casket
I will die with my heart dry and old
like the hearts of all people
I read about purity
it is the only thing that can take any shape
and can also destroy it
just as my brain
destroys apathetically
any command sent to the hand
prepared
to caress
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hatred invades me slowly
like a room full of water
with the slowness of an inquisitor
the october sun cuts strips off me
I lay traps for myself
the satisfaction of skin well stitched
I’ve waited patiently
for the disaster to happen
and it happened
I am a crow with eyes gouged out
I peck at myself mercilessly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I set some water to boil
didn’t have anything to put in it
I was all alone in the house
the water slowly evaporating
five-bit coins had gone out of circulation
they used to be really nice those coins
the water was still boiling
outside raindrops were falling
I wanted to get up and go out
it was growing dark outside
I sat on three-legged stools
the water evaporating beside me
I lay down to sleep night had fallen
the water still boiling now unheard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of all the things they do not tell and maybe 
even those which never happen are structures uttering real cities 
Clear delights Springing suddenly from awaiting years 
of whispers you had no chance to understand but coming out just when you pay no attention: Columns of breathing moods clear passions 
you could coldly pass over but each Question is to be found right inside your body Covering everything from the beginning
until somewhere in remote times even if you couldn’t yet recall: From the beginning to the end 
of history everything truly believes in one singular body and its parts some imaginary, others Caught in the middle of every movement 
and even pushed to periphery amidst the intensity of the day, intimacies – some kind of nails, growing like hair only to protect you 
from your noise from the heat of your each organ you use to light the peaceful flame of fascination Things that are just words 
they only are alive when uttered you are happy, otherwise they stay forever 
rustling silence and touching whenever all these 
are uttered somewhere still alive there is again the most beautiful person and for so many times, like the poem, like 
the city, that person is you 
the complete breathing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I refuse to think about people
for them, love is a black butterfly
that alights with widespread wings
on the brow of a paralysed gymnast
it stays there days on end
looking him tenderly in the eye
while it jabs its proboscis in the softest tissues
and enjoys itself like a child
it jabs in its proboscis and laughs
it jabs in its proboscis and laughs
under the dazzling sun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tonight I’m going to dance seven hours
for my life and my death with silken reins
then for love with rings and troubles
then for dull knives from serpentine bowels
then for fears sent cunningly no one knows where
then for god who slouches against the wall like a transvestite
then for the devil who lights the little flames in the granite chamber
and in the end I’m going to dance for the blood spilled
into the subterranean trough of an unidentified flying object
(my power of destruction and love is strong).
