take me with you to your places
where pleasure and ecstasy have not been invented
connect my heart with a rubber storm
connect my heart and let it soak
crossing fields devoid of light
a sterile landscape in which I can no longer
hide
linked to the eyes
re-routing your steps from day to day
your painful fragility

My life is an endless field of snow.
in front of the window, I tell you the snow is wiping everything,
all tracks.
I shattered the entire window that showed me,
I cannot stand it.
did not ask me why the left hand is flashing objects,
I cannot stand it.
My life is an endless field of snow.

the day I don't want to get up
as from an ice-cold sock
I will die with a dry and old heart
like everyone else
I read about purity
it is the only one that can take any form
and it can destroy it.
just like my brain
destroys apatic
any command to the hand
prepared
to boast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hate slowly invades me
like a room full of water
with the slowness of an inmate
October sun cuts corners in mine
pulling my own caps
satisfaction with well-consumed skin
we waited patiently
for the disaster to happen
and it happened
are a blindfolded corb
drinking from me without mercy

we have put water on the table
I had nothing to put in it.
I was alone in the house all the time
Water evaporates slowly
five-currency notes and coins out of circulation
and how nice they were
the water boiled further
outside raindrops fell
I wanted to shave and go
outside in the dark fell
we were standing on narrow stairs
with the water evaporating
I went to bed already it was night
The water boiled slowly and it dawned on us.

As far as I can tell, it is not.
even things that never happen are structures that take entire cities out of ghettos
Colourful Joys Unexpected for Many Years
of stairs you haven't even begun to understand, but just when you're not tired, they pop up: columns of breathing and tones of clear passages
over which you have passed coldly but every question is fixed in your body Spread over everything from the beginning
until a very long time ago, even if you couldn't remember it yet: From one end to the other
of history, everything sincerely believes in a single body with parts of it, some imagined, others Means in the middle of every movement
and even pushed into the margins in the intensity of the day, approaches like fingernails, like hair grown just to protect you
by your noise, by the warmth of every organ from which you kindle the calm flame of fascination Things that are only words
only when they are dreams there are joys, otherwise they remain forever
And the achievement every time all this
are said somewhere is still the most beautiful person and so many times, like the poem, as well as
the city, that person is you
complete breathing

I don't want to think about people.
their love is a black butterfly
with broad shoulders
standing on the head of a paralyzed gymnast
he's been there for days
he looks at him with tears in his eyes
puts his throat in his thickest teeth
plays like a child
Puts on his throat and laughs
Puts on his throat and laughs
in the bewildering sun.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at night I will dance for seven hours
for my life and death with cane knives
then for love with fairies and bears
then for the deadly cuts in the questionable marshes
then for the spaces sent to the bee knows with bitterness
then for him supported by a wall like a transvestite
then for the devil who makes small fires in the granite chamber.
and at the end I will dance for the blood spilled.
underground trawl of an unidentified flying object
(my power of destruction and love is great).
