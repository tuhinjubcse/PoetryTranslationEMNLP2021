Take me with you to your places
where pleasure and ecstasy have not been invented
Tie my heart to a rubber storm
Tie my heart and let it melt
passing through fields devoid of light
a barren landscape where they can no longer
to hide
eye-linked
I make way for the steps cut during the day
your painful fragility
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My life is a never-ending field of snow.
in front of the window, they tell you that the snow wipes everything,
all the way.
I have shattered my whole appearance,
I can't stand it.
Don't ask me why the left hand flashes objects,
I can't stand it.
My life is a never-ending field of snow.
to make love as if you were locked in an iron dungeon.
laugh until you're exhausted.
replaces one threaded head with another
And thy arms compass me violently, and make me stand in the midst of the things.
the sun as an incision in the winter sky.
to force the limits of control, to know the exact dosage,
All you have to do is not fall asleep.
I'm an endless field of murky snow.
I erase everything.
all the way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day I don't want to get up
Like out of an ice-cold cigar.
I'll die with a dry and old heart
as to all people
read about purity
she's the only one who can take any form
And yet she can destroy it.
as well as my brain
apatic destroyer
any command to the hand
prepared
to gloat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ura slowly invades me
like a chamber full of water
with the slowness of an inquisitor
October sun cuts holes in mines
I'll take my own capes
well-soaked skin satisfaction
I have waited patiently
to make the disaster happen
and it happened
I'm a corb with eyes open
I swear from mine without a hint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've put the water in the puddle
I didn't have anything to put in it.
I was alone in the house all the time.
The water slowly evaporates
five-euro coins withdrawn from circulation
And how nice they were
The water boiled further
Outside raindrops fell
I wanted to shave and leave
Out of the darkness fall
We were standing on scaffolds.
along with the water evaporates
I've been meaning to sleep since the night began.
The water boiled slowly and did not rise again.

Of all the things that can't be said
Even things that never happen are structures that take entire cities out of ghettos.
Clear blessings Unexpectedly recited for many years
of shocks that you have not dared to understand but exactly when you do not hear it appears: columns of breaths and tones of clear passions
Over which you have passed cold but every question is fixed in your body Into everything from the beginning
until a long time ago even if you could not remember yet: From one end to the other
of history everything sincerely believes in a single body with parts of it some imagined, others printed in the middle of every movement
and even wedged in margins in the intensity of the day, approaching like fingernails, like raised hair just to protect you
by your noise, by the warmth of every organ from which you fan the calm flame of fascination Things that are only words
Only when they're pissed off, there's joy, otherwise they stay forever.
And reaching out every time when all this happens
are said somewhere is still again the most beautiful person and So many times, as well as the poem,
Town, this person is you
complete respiration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't want to think about people
their love is a black butterfly
with extended wingspan
who waltzes on the forehead of a paralyzed gymnast
He's been there for days.
He looks into his eyes with amazement
He puts his throne in the most moi tissues.
he plays like a child
He puts on his horn and laughs
He puts on his horn and laughs
in the bewitching sunshine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the night you dance seven hours
for my life and death with catfish hooks
then for love with owls and whales
then for melted marrows
then for spaimele sent to naiba knows with viclenie
Then for him who is supported by a wall like a transvestite
then for the devil who makes small fires in the granite chamber
And at the end you will dance for the overthrown blood
in the subsea trough of an unidentified flying object
(my power of destruction and love is great).
