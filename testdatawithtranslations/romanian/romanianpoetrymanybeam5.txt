take me with you to your places
where pleasure and ecstasy were not invented
bandage my heart with a rubber storm
bandage my heart and let it soften
we cross fields filled with light
a barren landscape in which I can no longer
to hide
tied to the eyes
paving the way for your steps more than a day
your painful fragility

my life is an endless field of snow.
in front of the window, I tell you that snow erases everything,
all traces.
I shattered the window displaying me completely,
I can't bear it.
didnâ€™t ask me why the left hand explodes objects,
I can't bear it.
my life is an endless field of snow.
make love as if you were imprisoned in an iron prison.
to laugh until exhausted.
Replaces one threaded cap with another
and your arms encircle me violently and hold me between objects.
the sun like an incision in the winter sky.
to force the limits of control, to know the exact dosage,
all you have to do is not sleep.
are an endless field of murky snow.
I erase everything.
all traces.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the day I don't want to get up
like from an ice-cube
I will die with a dry and old heart
for all people
I read about purity
She is the only one who can take any form
and still it can destroy it
just as my brain
apatically destroys
every command to the hand
prepared
to boast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hatred slowly invades me
like a room full of water
with the slowness of an encloser
October sunlight cuts holes in mines
stretching out my capons alone
the satisfaction of skin well chewed up
I waited patiently
for disaster to happen
and it happened
I am a dark-eyed raven
I fumble in the mines without mercy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we put water on a bed
I had nothing to put in it
we were alone in the whole house
water slowly evaporates
the five coins were out of circulation
and how nice they still were
the water was still rumbling
outside piles of rain fell
I wanted to dry up and go away
the dark outside fell
we stood on the steppes of the scundles
alongside the water evaporates
I stretched out to sleep it was already night
the water rumbled slowly and dawned no farther
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all that is not said and perhaps
the very things that never happen are structures rocking entire cities from hills
Blessed lights Ridicated unexpectedly over the long years
of nightingales you didn't start to make out but just when you're no longer heard they appear: bells of breathing and clear tones of passion
you've been through so badly but every question ends up in your body Invading everything from the beginning
until sometime very far away even if you weren't able to remember: From one end to the other
of history believes everything in one body with parts of it some imagined, others real in the middle of every movement
and even pressed onto the margins in the daytime, approaches like nails, like hair just To protect you
by your noise, by the warmth of each organ from which you fan the calm flame of fascination Things that are only words
only when they are set there are you rejoicing, otherwise they stay forever
soothing silence And reaching every time all this
it's said somewhere there is still the most beautiful person again and So many times, like the poem,
city, this person it is you
complete breathing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't want to think about people
their love is a black butterfly
with outstretched wings
resting on the forehead of a paralysed gymnast
stands there for days on end
looks him in the eye with laughter
inserts its trumpet into the softest tissues
plays like a child
inflates his trumpet and laughs
inflates his trumpet and laughs
in the cruel sunlight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at night you will dance seven hours
for my life and death with cane fists
then for the love of rings and wreaths
then for the muted cuts in the doubtful marble
then for the spaces sent to the naiba knows with viclenie
then for the dummy supported by a wall like a transvestite
then for the devil who sets small fires in the granite chamber
and at the end you will dance for the converted blood
in the subfossil tracing of an unidentified flying object
(my power of destruction and of love is great).
