In a garden surrounded by vegetables
on top of a bunch of flowers,
one day the goddess of love entered,
with the goddess of hunting and of height.
Diana dropped rose water,
Venus a lily cloak, from the millenary;
but they excede to the other flowers
the violas, in grace and beauty.
They ask about Cupido, who was there,
which one of those three flowers would take,
for the most softest, most beautiful?
Sorrindose, the Minion made her:
all beautiful are, but I wanted
Hot like lipstick, or rose.
--------------------------------------................----------------
Mist, bad luck, bitter love
in my perdition they conspired;
mistakes and fortunateness rose,
that for me only love was enough.
All passes; but I’m so present
the great sorrow of the things that have passed,
I’ve been taught by the madness
to no longer be content.
I rehearse the speech of my years;
I set up a cause for Fortuna to punish
my ill-founded hopes.
Of love I only saw brief misunderstandings.
Oh! if I could, I’d
this my hard king of wars!
--------------------------------------................----------------
My gentle soul, you left
so early in this unhappy life,
rests in Heaven eternally,
and live I here in the ever sad land.
If in the ethereal frame, where you stand,
memory of this life is allowed,
don’t forget about that burning love
you already saw in my eyes so pure.
And if you come back, you’ll deserve it
the pain left to me
of grief, without remedy, of losing you,
pray to God, who inherited your years,
so far from here I can see you,
what far from my eyes took you.
--------------------------------------................----------------
For my eyes can’t stop crying
sadness, that don’t stop laughing at me;
so that it won’t burst the flame that burns me
who I’ve never been able to put away;
don’t beat the blind love to guide me
the part where I don’t know how to become me;
or let the whole world listen to me,
as long as my voice is weak to stay.
And if on the hills, rivers or forests
piety lives, or within it lies Love
in ferns, birds, stones, waters,
listen to the long story of my ills
and enjoy their pain with my pain;
that great sorrows can cure grief.
--------------------------------------................----------------
The lover transforms into beloved’s chosen,
by virtue of too much imagining;
I have, now, nothing more to wish for,
for I have in me the desired part.
If in it my soul is transformed,
body desires to reach?
He can rest in himself,
for I carry such a soul with me.
But this beautiful and pure semen,
that, like an accident in its subject,
with myself my soul conforms,
is in my mind as an idea:
the living and pure love for which I am made,
as simple matter searches for form.
--------------------------------------................----------------
Love brings new crafts, new ideas,
to kill me, and new exults;
that can’t take my hopes away,
will take away from me what I do not have.
Look at what hopes I hold!
See what dangerous securitys!
Not afraid of contrasts or changes,
in a brave sea, lost the lens.
But, since there can’t be pity
where hope is lacking, there I lie
Love a curse, killing and no one sees.
What days have my soul put to me.
one I don’t know what, born not where,
come from I don’t know how, and I do not know why.
--------------------------------------................----------------
While I break down the hills lit
of Heaven in a luminous glow,
for preventing from laughter the castity
in the hunting time Délia spent.
Venus, who then descended from stealing,
for enabling them to feel free,
seeing Diana with so much honesty,
longing for her, he said:
You walk with your nets in the mirrored
the fugitive beasts encrusted,
but my own senses.
– Milhor is (the pure deus)
in tight nets to take
to take you into them your husband.
--------------------------------------................----------------
Love is a fire burning without looking,
is a wound that hurts, and doesn’t feel;
is a contentment uncontented,
it’s pain that disinherites without crying.
It’s an unwillingness to be loved;
is a solitary walk between us;
is never to be content;
is a care that gains in being lost.
It’s wanting to be held by will;
to serve whoever wins, the winner;
to have someone who kills us, loyalty.
But how can it be in your favor
in human hearts friendship,
if it’s opposite to itself is the same Love?
--------------------------------------................----------------
In the world for a few years, and tired,
lived, full of cruel misery;
so early in the darkness of the day,
I didn’t see five finished lustres.
Crossing lands and seas,
seeking to life some remedy or cure;
but that which, in the end, doesn’t deserve venture,
don’t reach him with risky work.
Portugal has created me in green and face
my homeland my Alenquer; but air
that in my yard I had a vase,
made me gnaw of fish in you, bruto
of the sea, you strike in Abássia fain and wave,
so far from my beloved’s land!
--------------------------------------................----------------
Who sees, Lord, clear and manifesto
the beautiful being of your beautiful eyes,
if I don’t lose my view only in seeing them,
no longer pay for your gesture.
This seemed fair to me;
but I, for my own advantage,
I gave life and soul for believing them,
where I no longer find myself.
I feel life and soul and hope
and all I have, all is mine,
and I take advantage of it.
Because it’s such a blessing
to give you what I have and how I can
that, how much I pay you, more I owe to you.
