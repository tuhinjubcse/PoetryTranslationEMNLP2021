In a garden adorned with vegetables
who spread over it many flowers,
One day the goddess of love entered,
with the goddess of hunting and thickness.
Diana immediately took a pure rose,
Venus, a lily of the milkweed;
But they go far beyond the other flowers
the violas, in grace and beauty.
Ask Cupid, who was there,
Which of those three flowers would you take,
for softer, purer and fairer?
Sorrindose, the Minino would make him:
They're all beautiful, but I wanted to
Viol'ante que lírio, nor que rosa.
------------------------------------------
Mistakes of mine, misfortune, burning love
In my perdition they have rejoiced.
Mistakes and fortune have increased,
Love alone was enough for me.
I've been through everything, but I have so much
the great pain of the things that have passed,
that the wounded wraths have taught me
I don't want to be happy ever again.
I've missed all the speeches of my years;
I caused Fortune to punish
My ill-founded hopes.
I saw no love but short deceits.
Oh, if only I could fart.
This is my tough revenge genius!
------------------------------------------
My gentle soul, you broke
so early in this unhappy life,
resting in heaven forever,
And I live here in the land always sad.
If you're in the air seat, where you came from,
memory of this life if you will,
Don't forget that burning love
that you've seen in my pure eyes.
And if you see that it can earn you
All the pain I've been through
of the affliction, without remedy, of losing you,
Pray to God, who has shortened your years,
that so early from here I can see you,
How early my eyes took you.
------------------------------------------
'Cause my eyes can't stop crying
sadness, which does not tire me;
For it does not quench the fire in which it burns
put one I could never slow down;
# Don't wear out the blind # # Love to lead me #
the part where I don't know how to become;
Don't let the whole world hear me,
while my weak voice won't let up.
And if in the mountains, rivers or valleys,
Mercy is pure, or inwardly pure Love
In wounds, birds, grasses, stones, water,
Listen to the long history of my ills
and heal your pain with my pain;
that great sorrows can heal sorcery.
------------------------------------------
The lover becomes the thing loved,
by virtue of the much to be imagined;
I have, therefore, nothing more to desire,
for in me I have the desired part.
If there is in her a transformed soul,
What else does the body want to accomplish?
In you alone can rest,
for with me such a soul is bound.
But this beautiful and pure semideia,
that, as an accident in its subject,
so that my soul may be satisfied,
It's in the mind as an idea:
the living and pure love of which I am made,
as simple matter seeks form.
------------------------------------------
Love seek new arts, new craft,
to kill me, and new excuses;
that can't take my hopes away,
I'm afraid he'll take away what I don't have.
Look at the hopes I keep!
Look at these dangerous security guards!
That I fear neither contrast nor change,
Walking in brave seas, lost the wood.
But how can there be no disappointment
Where hope is lacking, there it hides me
Love an evil, that kills and can't be seen.
What days have I been in?
one I don't know what, that's born where,
Come I don't know how, and do I know why.
------------------------------------------
While February lights the mountains
from the sky with its brightness,
to prevent from greed chastity
In hunting time Delia is expensive.
Venus, who then descended from theft,
to seduce the desired from the unbelievers,
Seeing Diana in such honesty,
So I'd knock on her door and say,
- You go with your nets in thickness
the deer running away,
But mine make sense.
— Milhor is (responded to the pure goddess)
in the light nets dark go taking
to take you in your husband's arms.
------------------------------------------
Love is a fire that burns without seeing,
I'm hurt, and I can't feel myself.
It's a disgruntled contentment,
It's pain that goes away without hurting.
It's a not wanting more than good to want;
It's a lonely walk among us;
is never content with contentment;
He's a caretaker who gets lost.
It's wanting to be imprisoned by choice;
is to serve the victorious, the overcomer;
It's having someone to kill us with, loyalty.
But how can cause your favor
in human hearts friendship,
If so contrary to you is the same Love?
------------------------------------------
In the world a few years, and tired,
I have lived, full of bitter misery;
It was so early for me the light of the dark day,
I didn't see five finished mirrors.
I've traveled secluded lands and seas,
looking for life some medicine or cure;
but what, in the end, does not want vengeance,
You don't get it from risky jobs.
Created me Portugal in green and face
My homeland Alenquer; but the air corruto
that in this my vassal land I had,
He's got me fishing for you, you brute.
And the sea, which thou shalt break in the midst of it, and it shall break forth,
so far from my so-called homeland!
------------------------------------------
Who sees, lady, clear and manifest
the beautiful being of your beautiful eyes,
If you don't lose sight just by seeing them,
He no longer pays what he owes to your gesture.
This seemed like an honest price;
but I, by virtue of meriting them,
I gave more life and soul for wanting them,
where there's nothing left for me to do.
So that life and soul and hope
And all that I have, it's all yours,
And the payoff of that, I'll just take it.
'Cause it's such a bliss
I'll give you all I have and how much I can
that the more I pay you, the longer I owe you.
------------------------------------------
