In a green-decked garden
which is stained by various flowers,
entered one day the goddess of love,
with the goddess of hunting and thickness.
Diana took at once a pure rose,
A crimson lily, of the millehorses,
but exceed the other flowers
the violets, in beauty and grace.
They ask Cupid, who was there,
who would take those three flowers,
for the softest, purest and fairest?
To him the Minion was returning.
they’re all beautiful, but I wanted
Viol’ante que lírio, que rosa.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Mistakes of mine, misfortune, burning love
in my own perdition were conjured;
mistakes and fortunes rose,
that only love was enough for me.
I’ve been through everything; but I have so much
the great sorrow of things that have gone,
that wounded anger taught me
to not wanting to ever be content.
I miss all the talk of my years;
I gave fortune a cause to punish
my ill-founded hopes.
What I saw of love were brief deceptions.
Oh! who could so much as to flap
my stubborn genius of fortunes!
----------------------------------------------------------------
My gentle soul, you who have parted
so early in this unhappy life,
repose there in Heaven eternally,
and live here on the ever-sad earth.
If there in the ethereal aisle, where you arise,
memory of this life is allowed,
don’t forget that burning love
that I had already seen so pure in my eyes.
And if you see that it can deserve you
some thing the pain left to me
of sorrow, with no remedy, of losing you,
ask God, who has encircled your years,
that so soon from here I start to see you,
how quickly it took you out of my sight.
----------------------------------------------------------------
For my eyes are not tired of crying
sadnesses, that don’t tire of weighing me down;
since it doesn’t quench the fire in which to burn
put someone I’d never be able to calm down;
don’t tire the blind Love of guiding me
the part you can’t go back to;
nor let the whole world hear me,
as long as I don’t let my weak voice.
And if on hills and rivers or in valleys
pity must, or within must Love
in wounds, birds, plows, stones, water,
listen to the long story of my ills
and cure their pain with my pain;
that great sorrows can heal griefs.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The lover becomes the thing loved,
by the virtue of imagining much;
I have, of course, nothing more to wish for,
because in me I have the desired part.
If in it there’s a transformed soul,
what more does the body wish to achieve?
In itself alone it can rest,
for I have such a soul that I am bound.
But this beautiful and pure seed,
that, like an accident in its subject,
so with my soul it conforms,
is in thought as an idea:
the pure and living love of which I am made,
as simple matter seeks form.
----------------------------------------------------------------
To find Love new crafts, new skill,
to kill me, and new escapes;
that can’t take away my hopes,
that will take away what I don’t have.
Look at the hopes I keep!
See how dangerous safe havens are!
I don’t fear contrasts or changes,
wandering in brave seas, lost the linen.
But how much there can’t be grief
where hope is lacking, where I hide
Love an evil, that kills and is not seen.
How many days my soul has imprisoned me.
born I don’t know where,
come I don’t know how, or why.
----------------------------------------------------------------
While Phoebus lighted the hills
of Heaven with luminous clarity,
to avoid the chastity of oblivion
in the hunt the time Delia spends.
Venus, who then descended from theft,
to entangle the wishes of the Anquis,
seeing Diana in so much honesty,
so much injuring it, I told him:
— You move with your nets through the thickness
entangling the fugitive pigs,
but mine intertwine the meaning.
— Milhor is (responded to the pure goddess)
on the light blind nets taking
to take you as your husband.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Love is a fire that burns without seeing itself,
is a wound that I do not hesitate to heal;
is a dissatisfied contentment,
it’s a grief you desist from without pain.
It’s nothing more to want than to love well;
it’s a solitary walk among people;
is never to be content with contentment;
it’s a care that gains in losing itself.
It is to want to be imprisoned by will;
is to serve whoever wins, the winner;
is to have loyalty to the one who kills us.
But how it can bring about its own good
in human hearts friendship,
if the same Love is so opposite to itself?
----------------------------------------------------------------
In the world a few years, and weary,
I lived, full of vile and lasting misery;
it was so early the light of the dark day,
that I didn’t see five finished mirrors.
Running land and sea apart,
searching for some cure or cure for life;
but that which, at last, doesn’t want fortune,
they don’t achieve it with risky tasks.
Portugal created me in the green and expensive
my homeland Alenquer; but the hoary air
that I had a vase on this ground of mine,
made me sweep of fish in you, brute
the sea, that beats in the abyss savagely and atrociously,
so far from my godly homeland!
----------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever sees, Madam, clearly and manifestly
the beautiful being of your beautiful eyes,
if we don’t lose sight just to see them,
no longer pays what it owes to your gesture.
This seemed to me an honest price;
but I, for the advantage of earning them,
I gave my life and soul to seek them out,
where there’s nothing left to me.
So life and soul and hope
and all I have, it’s all yours,
and the good for it I take for granted.
Because it’s such a blessing
to give you as much as I have and can
that the more I pay you, I owe you more.
