To a garden luxuriously verdant
and enamelled with countless flowers,
there came one day the two goddesses
of Love, and of dense forests and Hunting.
Then Diana plucked a perfect rose
and Venus the best of the red lilies,
but exceeding by far all the other flowers
in beauty and grace were the violas.
They asked Cupid, who was standing near,
which of the blooms, in his opinion,
was sweetest, purest and most lovely?
The youngster answered with a grin:
— all three are gorgeous, but I much prefer
viola-tion to mere rose and lily.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My errors, cruel fortune and ardent love
conspired to bring about my ruin;
the errors and fortune were superfluous,
since love alone would have done as much.
of what I suffered is still so vivid
Although it’s over, the dreadful pain
that I, with bitter rage, have learned
never to try to be happy again.
In life and words I’ve always strayed,
giving Fortune cause to punish
my poorly founded hopes.
In love I’ve known just brief illusions.
Oh! if only my ruthless Genius
would have its fill of wreaking vengeance!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear gentle soul, you that departed
this life so soon and reluctantly,
rest in heaven eternally
while I remain here, broken-hearted.
If there in the ethereal skies
memories are still allowed to move,
do not forget that ardent love
you once saw shining in my eyes.
And if you judge there might be merit,
however small, in this pain that stays,
grieving with nothing to repair it,
petition God, who cut short your days,
to take me to you, in that reckless spirit
he used to summon you from my gaze.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since my eyes don’t tire of weeping
sorrows that don’t tire of weighing on me,
since nothing softens the fire I burn in
for one whose heart I could never soften,
let blind Love be my tireless guide
to lands I don’t know my way out of,
and let the whole world keep on listening
as long as my weak voice doesn’t fail.
And if in hills, rivers and valleys, 
there’s pity or there’s Love in beasts,
birds, plants, stones and streams,
let them hear my long tale of troubles
and use my sorrow to cure their own,
since greater griefs can cure smaller ones.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lover becomes the thing he loves
by virtue of much imagining;
the act of longing should be enough
since what I long for is already in me.
If my soul becomes the beloved,
what more can my body long for?
Only in itself will it find peace,
since my body and soul are linked.
But this pure, fair demigoddess,
like an accident with its subject,
who with my soul is in accord
exists in my mind as a mere idea;
the pure and living love I’m made of
seeks, like simple matter, form.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May Love seek out new arts, devise a plot
to kill me, and discover new disdain;
for robbing me of hope will be in vain,
since it can scarcely take what I’ve not got.
Behold the kind of hopes on which I stand!
And see how perilous my certainties!
For I fear neither change nor enmities,
ploughing the sea, lost far from any land.
And yet, although one cannot pay grief’s toll
where hope is gone, still has hidden there for me
Love an ill, that kills and can’t be seen;
how long ago did Love place in my soul
I don’t know what, born I don’t know where,
come I don’t know how, nor why it aches so keen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While Phoebus was lighting up the mountains
of Heaven with his radiant clarity,
to relieve the boredom of her chastity
Diana was killing time in hunting.
Then Venus who was descending secretly
to fetter the desire of Anchises,
seeing Diana so undisguised
addressed her half-jokingly:
“You come with your nets to the thick wood
to ensnare the fast-running deer,
but my own nets capture the mind.”
“Better”, the chaste goddess replied,
“to take the nimble deer in my snare
than be caught in one by your husband.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love is a fire that burns unseen,
a wound that aches yet isn’t felt,
an always discontent contentment,
a pain that rages without hurting,
a longing for nothing but to long,
a loneliness in the midst of people,
a never feeling pleased when pleased,
a passion that gains when lost in thought.
It’s being enslaved of your own free will;
it’s counting your defeat a victory;
it’s staying loyal to your killer.
But how can Love, when it chooses to,
bring human hearts into sympathy?
Is it Love if it’s so self-contradictory,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Few and wearisome years I lived
in the world, enduring vile hardship;
the light of day went dark on me
before I saw my twenty-sixth year.
I traveled distant lands and seas,
trying to find a cure for life,
what Fortune, finally, doesn’t will
perilous ventures can’t attain
Portugal brought me up in dear
green Alenquer, my home, but rotten
air in my earthen vessel changed me
into food for your fish, O vicious
sea that rages by Abyssinia,
so bleak and far from my happy homeland!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoever, Lady, sees plainly on view
your beautiful eyes in their lustrous being
without being blinded in the act of seeing
is already not paying your face’s due.
This seems to me an honest price,
but I, for the merit of deserving them,
gave both life and soul to serve them
apart from which I am without resource.
Enough that life and soul and hope
and as much as I have is all yours,
and the proof of this I alone know.
For such good fortune is beyond scope
giving you all that is in my power
as the more I pay you, the more I owe.
