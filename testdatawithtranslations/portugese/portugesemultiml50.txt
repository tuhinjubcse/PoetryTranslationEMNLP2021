It's a vegetable garden.
They painted on top of it various flowers.
One day the goddess of love entered.
with the goddess of hunting and thickness.
Diana then took a pure pink.
Venus is a liquid rock from the Milky Way.
But they exceed the other flowers a lot.
violas, for free and beautiful.
They asked Cupid, who was there.
What would those three flowers take?
how soft, how pure and how beautiful?
Surprised, Minino made him.
They're all beautiful, but I wanted them to be beautiful.
Violence that I kissed, not even pink.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
You're mine, bad luck, burning love.
In my loss, they were saved.
Mistakes and luck went up.
That love alone was enough for me.
It's all gone. But I'm so present.
The great pain of things that have happened.
that angry mothers taught me.
I don't want to ever be happy again.
I mispronounced the entire speech of my years.
I tried to get Fortune to punish me.
my misplaced hopes.
For love's sake, I've seen no shortage of deceptions.
Oh, who cares how much he farts?
This is my tough savings genius.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
My dear, gentle soul, you have parted.
So early on in this unhappy life,
It rests there in heaven forever.
And I live here on earth always sad.
If you're sitting in the airplane seat, where it's staying.
The memory of this life is consent.
Don't forget that burning love.
I've seen it before in my pure eyes.
And if you see it, it might be worth it.
There was no pain left in me.
It's about shame, no medicine, losing yourself.
I pray to God that your years will be fulfilled.
It makes me see you so early on.
how soon my eyes had taken you.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
Because my eyes don't stop crying.
sadness, which doesn't make me sad.
It doesn't light the fire that I'm about to burn.
put someone I could never slow down.
I don't sing the blind love to guide me.
The part where you don't know how to become.
I don't let the whole world listen to me.
While my voice fails me not to let go.
And if it's mountains, rivers or valleys.
pity lives, or love lives within.
It's in ferns, birds, grasses, stones, water.
Listen to the long story of my misfortunes.
And heal your pain with my pain.
that big bugs can heal big Bugs.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
It turns the lover into the thing you love.
It's the power of the imagination.
So I don't have much more to hope for.
Because in me, I have the desired part.
There's a transformed mind in it.
What is it that the body longs for the most?
In itself, it can rest.
Because I have such a soul, it's connected.
But this beautiful, pure seed.
It's like an accident in his subject.
So my soul is shaped.
It's in the mind as an idea.
The pure, living love that I'm made of.
as simple matter seeks form.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
Love seeks new skills, new talent.
to kill me, and new escapes.
I can't give up hope.
It's going to take away what I don't have.
Look how hopeful I am!
See how dangerous safety seats are!
I'm not afraid of contrasts or changes.
walking in the clear sea, losing the linen.
But how can there be no disgust?
Where hope is lacking, it hides me.
I love an evil that kills and I can't see it.
How many days my soul has waited for me.
I don't know what, I'm born where.
Comes, I don't know how, and I do not know why.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
As February goes by, the mountains start burning.
from the sky with bright light.
It's to avoid from pleasure to chastity.
In hunting, time is precious.
Venus, which then descended from theft.
It's about engaging the will of the Anquis.
I see Diana so honestly.
He was so jealous of her, he told her.
You go with your nets in the thickness.
The fugitives are circling around.
But mine make sense.
Milhor is (pure goddess responds)
in light, dark nets.
to take you in your husband's arms.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
Love is a fire that burns invisibly.
It's a painful wound, and it doesn't feel.
It's discontentment.
It's pain that goes away without pain.
It's one of wanting no more than to want well.
It's a lonely walk among people.
It's never contentment.
It's a caregiving that pays to lose.
It's wanting to be caught at will.
It's serving whoever wins, the winner.
It's having someone kill you, loyalty.
But how can it work in their favor?
In human hearts, friendship.
if so contrary to itself is the same Love?
----------------------------------------------------------------.
In the world of a few years, and tired.
I'm alive, full of bitter misery.
It was so early in the dark daylight.
I didn't see five finished mirrors.
I've traveled to remote lands and seas.
They're looking for some medicine or a cure in life.
But the thing that doesn't want to win anyway.
They don't achieve it in high-risk jobs.
Portugal created me in green and face.
Alenquer, my great-grandmother.
That's what my vascular soil had to do with it.
It made me throw fish at you, gross.
The sea, which you smash into the abyss, will swell and collapse.
So far from my so-called homeland.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
Whoever sees, Madam, clear and manifest.
The beautiful being of your beautiful eyes.
If you don't lose your sight just by seeing them.
It no longer pays for your gesture.
This seemed like an honest price to me.
But I, for my own good, deserve them.
I gave more life and soul for them.
where there's nothing left for me to do.
So life and soul and hope.
And everything I have, everything is yours.
And the benefit of that I just take away.
Because it's such an auspicious thing.
I'm going to give you as much as I have and how much I can.
that the more I pay you, the less I owe you.
----------------------------------------------------------------.
