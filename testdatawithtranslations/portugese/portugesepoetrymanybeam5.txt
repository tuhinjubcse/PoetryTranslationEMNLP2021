In a garden adorned with green
which has been stained by various flowers,
one day the goddess of love came in,
with the goddess of hunting and thirst.
Diana at once took an ointment of pure rose,
Venus a lily red, of the fireflies;
but exceed all other flowers
the violas, in their grace and beauty.
They asked Cupid, who was there,
which one of those three flowers would I take,
the softest, purest and most beautiful?
It smiled, the Tin Man looked back at it:
are all beautiful, but I’d like
Viol’ante que lírio, que rosa.
--------------------------------------
Mistakes of mine, misfortune, ardent love
into my perdition;
mistakes and fortune rose,
that for me love alone was enough.
Everything has passed; but I have so much
the great ache of things that have passed,
that the wounded wives taught me
not wanting ever to be happy again.
I erred in all the discourse of my years;
I’ve given Fortune a cause to punish
my ill-founded hopes.
All I saw of love were brief delusions.
Oh! if only I could have you speed up
this stubborn genius of mine!
--------------------------------------
My gentle soul, that parted with you
so early in this discontented life,
rests there in Heaven for evermore,
and here I live in the always sad earth.
If there in the ethereal meeting, where you arose,
memory of this life is allowed,
don’t forget that burning love
which you had already seen so purely in my eyes.
And if you see it can earn you
some thing the pain left to me
of the sorrow, with no remedy, of losing you,
I pray God, who has enclosed your years,
that so soon from here you take me to see you,
how soon it had taken you out of my sight.
--------------------------------------
For my eyes are not tired of crying
sadness, which does not tire of boring me;
since it does not curb the fire in which to burn me
set aside what I’ve never been able to calm;
don’t tire the blind Love of guiding me
the part where I can’t return;
nor let the whole world hear me,
while my weak voice cannot be silenced.
And if on hills, rivers or in valleys
piety abides, or else within it dwells Love
in ferns, birds, toads, stones, water,
listen to the long history of my sins
and cure your pain with my pain;
that big wounds can heal big ones.
--------------------------------------
The lover is transformed into the beloved,
by the power of the great imagination;
I have, of course, nothing more to wish for,
for in me I have the desired part.
If there is in it a transformed soul,
what more does the body want to achieve?
In itself it can rest content,
for I am bound with such a soul.
But this beautiful and pure seed,
which, like an accident in its subject,
so that my soul will conform,
is in the mind as an idea:
the living and pure love of which I am made,
how simple matter finds its form.
--------------------------------------
Find for Love new craft, new skill,
to kill me, and new squalls;
which cannot take away my hopes,
that I’ll miss what I don’t have.
You looked at the hopes I held me!
Dangerous safety nets!
That I fear neither contrasts nor changes,
walking on brave seas, having lost the linen.
But how much there can be no grief
where hope is lacking, hides
Love an ill, that kills and is not seen.
How long it has lain in my soul.
an I don’t know what, that’s born I know not where,
come I don’t know how, or why.
--------------------------------------
While Phoebus ignites the hills
of Heaven with a luminous clarity,
to avoid chastity from the boredom
in the hunt time delays Delia.
Venus, that then descended from theft,
by enslaving Anchises’ will,
seeing Diana in so much honesty,
when he saw her, he said:
— You with your nets in the thickness
entangling the fugitive deer,
but mine spread the sense.
“He is Milhor” (pure goddess replied)
in slight blind nets taking over
than to take you for your husband.
--------------------------------------
Love is a fire that burns without being seen,
it’s a wound that I inflict, and you don’t feel it;
is a dissatisfied contentment,
it’s a pain that unsettles without pain.
It is to want no more than to love well;
it’s a solitary walk among the people;
is never to be satisfied with contentment;
is a care that wins in being lost.
Is wanting to be taken for granted;
is to serve the winner, the one who wins;
is to be loyal to the one who kills us.
But how it can bring about its favor
in human hearts friendship,
if so opposite is the same Love?
--------------------------------------
In the world a few years, and tired,
I lived, full of vile and harsh misery;
the light of the dark day fell on me so soon,
that I didn’t see five finished mirrors.
Running seas and lands apart,
searching for some medicine or cure for life;
but what, in the end, doesn’t want fortune,
are not reachable by hazardous jobs.
Portugal created me in the green and face
my home Alenquer; but the rusty air
that I had in my vassal terrain,
made me wash with fish in you, brute
sea, that you beat savagely on the Persian sea
so far from my despotic homeland!
--------------------------------------
Whoever sees, O Lady, clearly and manifestly
the beautiful being of your beautiful eyes,
if you don’t lose your sight just by seeing them,
no longer pays what it owes for your gesture.
This seemed to me an honest price;
but I, having the advantage of earning them,
I gave my life and soul more for them,
where there’s nothing left for me.
So that life and soul and hope
and all I have, it’s all yours,
and I’m the only one who sees the benefit.
Because it is so much chance
to give you what I have and how much I can
that the more I pay you, I owe you more.
