In a garden adorned with vegetables
to which they scatter over several flowers,
One day the goddess of love entered,
with the goddess of hunting and thickness.
Diana immediately took the purple rose,
Venus a purple lily, of the milhores;
but they exceed the other flowers
the violas, in grace and fragrance.
They ask Cupid, who was there,
Which one of those three flowers would take,
for softer, purer and more beautiful?
Sorrindose, the Minino would make you:
all beautiful are, but I wanted
Violent as lily, neither rose.
-------------------------------------------------------
My mistakes, bad fortune, burning love
in my perdition they conjoined.
the mistakes and the fortunes rose,
That love was enough for me alone.
I've been through everything, but I have so much present
the great pain of the things that have passed,
that the wounded rage taught me
to not ever be happy anymore.
I've made all the speeches of my years;
I gave cause [to] fortune to punish
my poorly formed hopes.
I have seen nothing but short deceptions in love.
Oh, if only I could fart.
My hard-ass revenge genius!
-------------------------------------------------------
My sweet soul, you broke
So early in this miserable life,
rests there in heaven eternally,
and live I in the land always sad.
If it's in the elder seat, where it stands,
memory of this life if consented,
Don't forget that burning love
that you have seen in my eyes so pure.
And if you see that it can earn you
♪ I can't help the pain that's left me
of grief, no medicine, of losing you,
pray to God that your years are shortened,
That as soon as I get out of here to see you,
How early my eyes took you.
-------------------------------------------------------
'Cause my eyes can't stop crying
sorrows, which do not tire me;
♪ 'Cause it won't stop the fire I'm opening
who I could never slow down.
# Don't beat the blind # # Love to lead me
the part where I cannot become;
Don't let the whole world hear me,
while my weak voice won't let go.
And if in the mountains, rivers or valleys,
mercy lives, or in love lives
in ferns, birds, flocks, stones, waters,
Listen to the long history of my ills
and cherish their pain with my pain;
that great hurts can heal bad.
-------------------------------------------------------
The amateur becomes the beloved thing,
by virtue of too much imagination;
I have, therefore, nothing more to desire,
for I have the desired part in me.
If in it is the transformed soul,
What more does the body want to achieve?
In itself can rest,
because with me such soul is liable.
But this beautiful, pure spirit,
which, as an accident on his subject,
my soul conforms,
It's in my mind as an idea:
the living and pure love of which I am made,
how simple matter seeks form.
-------------------------------------------------------
Busque Love new arts, new craft,
to kill me, and new squirrels;
who can't take my hopes away,
It will hardly take away what I don't have.
Look what hope I have!
Look at those dangerous security guards!
That I fear neither contrast nor change,
I've been out in the sea, lost the wood.
But there can be no sorrow
Where hope is lacking, I hide
Love a evil, that kills and does not see.
How many days have it taken me.
one I don't know what, born I do not know where,
I don't know how, and it hurts.
-------------------------------------------------------
♪ While the moonlight was lit
of the sky with bright clarity,
for preventing castity from being exercised
The time Délia spent on the hunt.
Venus, which then of theft descended,
for captivating the will of the Ancestors,
seeing Diana in all honesty,
He was yelling at her, saying:
- You go with your nets in thickness
the fleeing cervians encircling,
But mine make sense.
— Milhor is (respond to the pure goddess)
in the lighter nets and taking
to take you into them your husband.
-------------------------------------------------------
Love is a fire that burns without seeing,
it hurts, and it's not feeling.
is a discontented contentment,
It's pain that stops without hurting.
It's a no-want more than a well-wishing;
It's a lonely walk among us.
is never to be contented;
It's a caretaker who wins by losing himself.
It's wanting to be trapped by will;
it is to serve the victor, the winner;
It's to the one who kills you, loyalty.
But how to cause may your favor
in human hearts friendship,
if so contrary to you is the same Love?
-------------------------------------------------------
In the world few years, and tired,
I have lived, full of terrible misery;
It was so early in the dark daylight,
That I didn't see five finished lamps.
I ran dry lands and seas,
seeking to life some remedy or cure;
but what, in the end, does not want venture,
You can't reach him through risky work.
Created me Portugal in green and face
my fatherland, but aircorruto
which in my land was a vase,
Made me smell fish on you, crude
sea, that battling Abássia fera and avara,
So far away from my own dictatorship!
-------------------------------------------------------
Who sees, ma'am, clear and manifest
the beautiful being of your beautiful eyes,
If I don't lose sight just by looking at them,
He's no longer paying for your gesture.
This one seemed like an honest price.
but I, for what benefit, deserve them,
I gave up my life and my soul for wanting them,
where there's no more room for me.
I have signed life and soul and hope
and all I have is yours,
And the benefit of that I only take.
'Cause it's such a blessing
To give you how much I have and how little I can
that the more I pay you, the merrier I owe you.
